---

Deciding on the right product for your needs can often be a critical part of ensuring the success of your launch. If you're considering Web3Auth for
your project, the following qualifying questions will help you understand which of our products best fits your requirements.

Choosing the right Web3Auth product involves a careful analysis of what each option offers.

:::warning Pre Planning Product Requirements

This document helps you understand the differences between the products and helps you make the right choice for your project. This is a very important
step in the Web3Auth Integration process, please make sure you're making the right choice for your project. **We would recommend you to the SDKs in
the same stack of products within Web3Auth to minimize the migration efforts.**

:::

## Choosing the Right SDK

- **Plug and Play SDKs** are designed for quick, easy integration, offering a predefined UI/UX suitable for projects with speed as a priority.

- **Core-Kit SDKs** provide a customizable and hands-on approach for developers who want full control over the UI/UX and authentication flows, ideal
  for enterprises and in-depth customizations.

- **Wallet Ecosystems** offer a blend of integration ease and ecosystem-specific advantages, perfect for projects looking to integrate closely with
  existing wallet platforms and their communities.

:::tip

If you're considering using the **Core Kit Multi Factor Auth SDKs** in the future and want a quick integration to start off, we recommend you use the
Single Factor Auth SDKs right now and then move to the Multi Factor Auth SDKs later. This will help you minimize the migration efforts from Plug and
Play to Core Kit.

In a case, where you have already integrated Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs and want to move to Core Kit, we recommend you read our
[Troubleshooting Document around Key Migrations](/troubleshooting/different-private-key#migrating-between-sdks).

Choosing the right Web3Auth product is key to a successful project launch. The following qualifying questions aim to guide you through the
decision-making process. They cater to diverse project requirements and explore various key considerations. By reflecting on these questions, you'll
be better equipped to make an informed decision that ensures your selected Web3Auth product aligns seamlessly with your needs, laying a solid
foundation for your project's success.

We've divided the questions into the following categories:

- [Basic Product Questions](#basic-product-questions)
- [UI/ UX Questions](#ui-ux-questions)
- [Infrastructure Questions](#infrastructure-questions)
- [SSS vs MPC Questions](#sss-vs-mpc-questions)

## Basic Product Questionaire

### What are you building? A dApp or a Wallet?

- If you're building a Wallet, our Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs can provide a quick and effective solution, although a better user experience for a
  wallet might come from our Core Kit SDKs, where Web3Auth is hidden. You just need to put in additional engineering efforts to build the UX flows.
  You can switch between any of our SDKs in the future, however, it is important to consider you're choosing the right configuration for the future
  migration to be easier.

  :::

- If you're building a dApp any of our products can be useful, however, with Web3Auth PnP or Core Kit Solutions, you would need to manage the UX Flows
  and Interoperability yourself. Plug and Play can be quite useful as it contains some pre-made flows to make the integration easier. Torus Wallet is
  a great integration too, but it is an independent wallet, so any of the UX flows will not be in your control.

  :::

### What chain are you building on?

- The good news is that Web3Auth is chain agnostic. That means you can build on any chain you prefer. We support `SECP256K1` and `ED25519` key curves
  out of the box, and with private key manipulation, one can connect any chain. There are specialized providers for EVM, Solana and XRPL.
- Wallet Ecosystems are available across specific chains, please read across their particular integrations.

### What platform are you using?

- Plug and Play SDKs support Web, Mobile (Android and iOS), Hybrid (React Native and Flutter) and Gaming (Unity and Unreal) environments.
- Core Kit SDKs support Web, Mobile (Android and iOS), and React Native environments.
- Wallet Ecosystems differ based on the specific Wallet Ecosystem's support and integration capabilities.

### What level of interoperability do you need?

- For a fully interoperable flow, use Wallet Ecosystems products which give you exception interoperability features across their own ecosystem and
  your dApp.

- Using Wallet Services, you can have your own PnP or Core Kit integration fully interoperable using Wallet Connect or any Wallet Ecosystem as well.
  use the Torus wallet in your application.

## UI/ UX Questions

### Do you require a prebuilt UI/UX for Login/MFA?

- If you want a ready-made solution, use our Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs.
- If you prefer to craft your own UI/UX for your users, the Web3Auth Core-Kit SDKs are the way to go.
- Wallet Ecosystems offer a tailored integration with specific Wallet Ecosystems, leveraging their UI/UX.

### Do you need auto-signing?

- By auto-signing, we mean that the UX for approving the transaction is controlled by the application itself. This can only be done when the
  application has access to the private key/ user signature.
- Both Plug and Play SDKs and Core-Kit SDKs feature auto signing, removing the need for your users to approve each transaction.
- Wallet Ecosystems do not support auto-signing, as the user has to approve the transaction in the wallet itself.

## Infrastructure Questions

### Do you want to manage the MFA Infrastructure?

- If you'd like to maintain ownership of the MFA Infrastructure, our Core-Kit SDKs are the best choice for you.

### Do you want to manage the Login Infrastructure ie. use any existing Social Logins (e.g. Google, FB, etc…), or a passwordless login of your own?

- Both our Plug and Play and Core Kit SDKs allow you to manage your own Login Infrastructure. It is a feature called Custom Authentication in Plug and
  Play SDKs and a requirement for Core Kit SDKs.
- Wallet Ecosystems do not support managing the login infrastructure, as they rely on the Wallet Ecosystem's authentication mechanisms.

### Do you want to customize the storage and threshold of the user key shares?

- The Web3Auth Plug and Play SDK gives you the standard way of storing the user key shares. If you want to customize the storage of the user key
  shares, you can use our Core Kit SDKs.
- With Core Kit SDKs, you can customize the threshold and the number of shares required to recover the user key. You can also customize the storage of
  the user key shares. From Device share storage to Social Recovery, QR backups, Email Backups, Database encrypted storage etc. you can choose the
  flow you want to use.
- Wallet Ecosystems do not support customizing the storage and threshold of the user key shares, as they rely on the Wallet Ecosystem's protocols and
  tools.

## SSS vs MPC Questions

### Do you want the user key to be present on the application frontend?

- If you're looking to keep the user key in the frontend, our traditional SDKs, powered by Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, can be a good choice for
  you.
- If you prefer to keep the user's keys divided the whole time and only have a temporary sign generated when the user is signing, our new SDKs,
  powered by the Threshold Signature Scheme, are the way to go.

### Do you want to import keys from other wallets?

- If you want to import keys from other wallets, you can use our Core Kit SDKs.
- The Core Kit SDKs have the option of key import, however, it has the trade-off of key generation integrity. This is because to maintain
  noncustodiality, we make sure that the key imported is encrypted by the Web3Auth generated key, and stored on the metadata server. It is not
  possible to directly import a key and distribute it into multiple parts within the Shamir Secret Sharing infrastructure.
- The best place to import keys can be the MPC Infrastructure. With the import key API in our MPC SDKs, it is possible to import up to 4 keys directly
  into the MPC infrastructure. However, as you import multiple keys, the user interaction tends to become slower.

### Do you want your user to be able to export their key?

- If you want your users to be able to export their key, you can any of our SDKs.
- With SSS-based SDKs, the key is reconstructed on every login, so the user can export the key at any point in time.
- With MPC-based SDKs, the key reconstruction never happens, hence the process of exporting the key is a bit more complex. Exports can be done via an
  open-source external script that can be locally run. Alternatively, we’re in the midst of developing a simple binary that could be operated to
  combine the factors.
