The **Core-Kit Wallet Management SDKs** cater towards a more hands-on, customizable approach while creating your own experience toward user
onboarding. Tailored for developers who prioritize direct control and customization over their authentication flows, the Core-Kit allows for the
creation of sophisticated, user-centric authentication processes, where Web3Auth operates seamlessly in the background, invisible to the end-user.

## Key Features:

- **Customizable UI & UX:** Empowers developers to design and implement their own user interfaces and experiences for login and multi-factor
  authentication (MFA), ensuring a seamless and cohesive brand presentation.

- **Owning the Infrastructure:** Provides the flexibility for developers to fully control the wallet management and authentication flows, aligning
  with specific project requirements and enhancing security.

- **No Redirection:** Distinguishes itself from the Plug and Play model by eliminating the need for user redirection to `auth.web3auth.io` for
  authentication. This integration ensures all authentication flows are contained within your application, offering a more integrated and
  uninterrupted user experience.

- **Platform Compatibility:** Maintains broad support across major platforms, including Web, React Native, iOS, and Android, ensuring developers can
  leverage Core Kit's capabilities regardless of the target environment.

Core Kit is meticulously segmented into two distinct parts: **Single Factor Authentication (SFA)** and **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**, each
designed to cater to varying levels of security and user interaction preferences within your application framework. While SFA offers a streamlined
onboarding process, MFA introduces a more robust security mechanism by employing a 2 out of 3 (2/3) Key Share setup, enhancing the authentication's
non-custodial nature.

## Single Factor Authentication (SFA)

The SFA SDKs provide the most streamlined process for user onboarding within the Web3Auth ecosystem. This straightforward approach allows users to
quickly gain access by simply clicking on the login button and connecting to their preferred social account through OAuth, or opting for a
passwordless flow such as email-passwordless or biometric authentication. Upon successful authentication, a private key is generated and securely
delivered to your application, reconstructed within its environment.

This process employs a 1/1 Key Share setup, where the complete key, facilitated by the Web3Auth Auth Network's key shares, is directly integrated into
your application. Despite its simplicity, this flow adheres to non-custodial principles, thanks to the Web3Auth network's 5/9 consensus mechanism for
generating key shares. However, it's worth noting that, due to the reliance on OAuth provider credentials for key generation, this method could be
considered semi-custodial.

To enhance security and ensure a fully non-custodial experience, it's recommended that users activate MFA. This additional layer introduces a 2/3 Key
Share setup, solidifying the authentication process's non-custodial nature and offering an elevated level of security and control to the user.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

The MFA component of the Core Kit is designed for heightened security and user control. In this 2/3 setup, users are endowed with three key shares:
ShareA, ShareB, and ShareC, each serving a distinct role in the authentication process:

- **ShareA:** This share is managed and distributed within Web3Auth's Auth Network. Users can access this share through an OAuth login provider that
  they own, such as a Google account. This ensures that one of the key components of their authentication is tied to a familiar and secure service.

- **ShareB:** Designed to reside directly on the user's device, ShareB's storage method is inherently tied to the device and operating system's
  capabilities. For example, on mobile devices, this share might be secured in device storage protected by biometric authentication, providing both
  convenience and security.

- **ShareC:** Acting as a recovery share, ShareC offers an additional layer of security. Users can choose to store this share on a different device,
  download it for offline keeping, or even base it on user input such as a password, security questions, or even a physical hardware device.

To access their wallet, users must demonstrate ownership of at least two of these three shares, akin to traditional Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
systems. This requirement ensures a robust security framework, significantly mitigating the risk of unauthorized access while still offering
flexibility and recovery options for the user.

The Core-Kit Wallet Management SDKs are designed for projects that require a tailored approach to authentication, providing the tools and flexibility
necessary to build advanced, secure, and integrated authentication systems. This approach not only enhances the user experience by keeping all
interactions within the native application environment but also gives developers the unprecedented ability to mold and adapt the authentication
process to meet the exact needs of their user base.
