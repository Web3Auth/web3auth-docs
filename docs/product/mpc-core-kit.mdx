The Web3Auth MPC Core Kit provides a powerful Multi-Party Computation (MPC) based authentication
system using Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS). Unlike traditional key-based authentication systems
that reconstruct private keys, MPC Core Kit never reconstructs the key, making it significantly more
secure.

:::note

The MPC Core Kit is designed for applications that need advanced security and complete control over
their authentication flows. It provides the necessary tools and flexibility to build sophisticated
authentication systems while maintaining high security standards.

## How MPC Core Kit Works

Using the Web3Auth MPC Core Kit, you can authenticate users and generate signatures for blockchain
transactions through distributed key shares, without ever reconstructing the private key. The SDK
uses a 2-of-3 threshold signature scheme where the key shares are distributed across:

- **Auth Network Share:** Managed by Web3Auth's decentralized Auth Network and accessible through
  OAuth providers like Google, providing a familiar authentication experience.

- **Device Share:** Securely stored on the user's device, leveraging platform-specific security
  features like biometric authentication on mobile devices.

- **Recovery Share:** A backup share that can be stored on a secondary device, downloaded for
  offline storage, or derived from user input like passwords or security questions.

To sign transactions, users need access to any two of these three shares. The shares independently
create partial signatures which are then combined using TSS to create the final valid signature.

## Key Features

- **Uncompromised Security:** Private keys are never reconstructed, eliminating key compromise risks
  through distributed MPC architecture.

- **Seamless Integration:** Build end-to-end authentication flows directly in your application with
  complete UI/UX control.

- **Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure:** Non-custodial MPC wallet infrastructure with automated
  recovery mechanisms ensures maximum security and reliability.

- **Flexible Authentication:** Support for social logins, passwordless methods, and existing auth
  systems provides comprehensive authentication options.

- **Developer-First Design:** Direct integration capabilities and customizable interfaces enable
  building sophisticated authentication flows that match your brand.
