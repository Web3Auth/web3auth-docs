Web3Auth's Plug and Play (PnP) integration lets you add a fully-featured, secure embedded wallet to
your app in just 4 lines of code. Simply initialize the SDK, configure your settings, and you're
ready to go - we handle everything from authentication flows to wallet management behind the scenes.
Available across all major platforms including Web, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, and
Unreal, PnP comes with full white-labeling options to match your brand. The result is a seamless,
non-custodial wallet solution that just works.

## How Plug and Play Works

Web3Auth PnP follows a simple and secure authentication flow:

1. When a user initiates login, they are redirected to `auth.web3auth.io`
2. The Web3Auth portal handles the authentication process and redirects to their chosen login
   provider (Google, Twitter, etc.)
3. After successful authentication, Web3Auth securely reconstructs the user's private key
4. The user is redirected back to your application with their application-specific key
