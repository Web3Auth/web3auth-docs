Web3Auth's Plug and Play (PnP) SDKs are engineered to redefine the key management integration for
wallets and dApps, focusing on efficiency, user convenience, and security. These SDKs are not just
tools for facilitating blockchain transactions but are embedded wallet solutions designed to merge
seamlessly into your application, offering a robust framework for user authentication and wallet
management.

The PnP Integration is generally a 10-minute integration process and is designed to be a
non-custodial solution by default. It offers a predefined UI/UX flow, with full white-labeling
options, and is available for all major platforms. This helps you to focus on your core product,
while we take care of the wallet management and user authentication.
