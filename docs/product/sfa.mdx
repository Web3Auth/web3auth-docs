Single Factor Auth(SFA) provides the most seamless Web3 onboarding experience possible by making it
feel completely like Web2. Users can access your application with just one click through their
existing social accounts or passwordless methods, while Web3Auth works invisibly in the background
to generate their wallet. There's no redirection - everything happens within your application
interface, making it feel native and familiar to all users Web2/ Web3 alike.

## How Single Factor Auth Works

The authentication flow is straightforward yet secure:

1. Users click to login with their preferred method (social login, email, biometrics etc.), hosted
   by the application itself
2. Web3Auth silently generates a wallet using Shamir's Secret Sharing
3. The private key is split into shares, distributed across the Web3Auth Auth Network (using a 5/9
   consensus mechanism) and derived from the user's identity after authentication.
4. The complete wallet is reconstructed within your application environment

The diagram below illustrates how Web3Auth's SFA infrastructure seamlessly integrates within your
application:

This 1/1 key share setup, while simple, maintains security through Web3Auth's distributed network.
The process is semi-custodial since it relies on OAuth provider credentials, but users can upgrade
to full non-custodial security by activating Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) which introduces a
2/3 key share setup.
