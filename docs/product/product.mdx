Our extensive product suite covers everything from pre-onboarding to post-onboarding and
authentication, enabling you to craft a seamless end-to-end experience for your Web3 dApp/ Wallet.

## Web3Auth for Wallets

One of the most important use cases of Web3Auth is to integrate it within wallets. This is because
Web3Auth itself is not a wallet, it is wallet infrastructure that can be plugged into your own
wallet. Web3Auth results in a standard cryptographic key provider specific to the user and
application. This key provider can be used to sign transactions, and messages, or make any other
wallet transaction.

A wallet is a wrapper around the user's private key, helping them manage their account on a much
better level. With Web3Auth, you can make the UI flow according to your own needs and requirements,
while not thinking about the key generation and management part. Web3Auth will take care of that for
you. You can even save additional private keys safely within your application with Web3Auth.

### Advantages of using Web3Auth Wallet Key Management

1. The wallet owns the whole experience, with minimal external branding. You can even surpass that
   (have **zero Web3Auth Branding**) if you use [**Web3Auth Core Kit**](/product/core-kit).
2. Ability to use your **own OAuth 2.0 / Single Sign-On** or any other flow for validating your
   user. You just need to provide Web3Auth with a JWT `id_token` and it will handle the key
   generation for you.
3. Create your wallet for **any chain**, depending on your needs. Web3Auth generates the private key
   that can be used for any chain.
4. Add security and key recoverability features like **MPC**, **Account Abstraction**, and more to
   your wallet, natively.
5. You can choose a platform of your choice. Web3Auth SDKs are available for most mobile, web and
   gaming platforms.

## Web3Auth for dApps

As a decentralized application, if you're looking for more customized flows for your application,
Web3Auth is the way for you to go. While using a wallet might be the easiest way for you to handle
blockchain transactions, it comes with the cost of sacrificing the control of the user flow and
trusting them with the understanding of how to make a blockchain transaction. This also comes with
the cost of losing users to complex terminologies and flows, which can be easily avoided if you're
customizing flows according to your needs. While using Web3Auth, you have the flexibility of
creating your embedded wallet within your application or using one of our **Wallet Ecosystems** that
can handle the complexity of linking your application to a wallet.

1. The dApp owns the whole experience, with minimal external branding. You can even surpass that
   (have **zero Web3Auth Branding**) if you use [**Web3Auth Core Kit**](/product/core-kit).
2. First-time users don't need the mental overhead of understanding the concept of a "wallet" to use
   your application. Just a standard Web2 login, they're onboarded using Web3Auth.
3. Quick integrations with **Wallet Ecosystems**, like **SafeAuth**, **Torus Wallets**, and more.
4. **Embedded Wallets** within your application, with the ability to use your own OAuth 2.0 / Single
   Sign-On or any other flow for validating your user.
5. You can create your application for **any chain**, depending on your needs. Web3Auth generates
   the private key that can be used for any chain.
6. You can have users interact with their wallet and make transactions within your application,
   making the **whole experience more seamless and specific to your app**.
7. You can use the variety of **interoperability** flows provided by Web3Auth to make your
   application's private key more accessible to users.

## Relationship between Web3Auth SDK and Integrating dApp/ Wallet

When a user logs in with a login provider like Google, it sends a JWT id_token to the app. This JWT
token is sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function. The Web3Auth SDK will then validate the JWT
token with the set parameters in the Web3Auth Dashboard and accordingly generate a private key, in a
self-custodial way, resulting in easy onboarding for your user to the application.
