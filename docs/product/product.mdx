Our extensive product suite covers everything from pre-onboarding to post-onboarding and
authentication, enabling you to craft a seamless end-to-end experience for your Web3 dApp/ Wallet.

## Web3Auth for Wallets

Web3Auth is designed to be integrated into wallets as a key management infrastructure. It provides a
secure, user-specific cryptographic key provider that can be used for transaction signing, message
signing, and other wallet operations.

As a wallet developer, you can focus on building your custom UI and user experience while Web3Auth
handles the complexities of key generation, management and storage behind the scenes. The wallet
acts as a user-friendly interface to manage private keys and accounts, with Web3Auth powering the
core key infrastructure.

#### Advantages of using Web3Auth Wallet Management

- **Full control over branding and UX** - even remove Web3Auth branding completely.
- **Use your own authentication** - integrate any OAuth 2.0/SSO flow by providing a JWT Token.
- **Chain-agnostic** - generated wallets work across any blockchain
- **Built-in security** - native support for **MPC**, **Account Abstraction**, and key recovery
- **Cross-platform support** - SDKs available for web, mobile and gaming platforms

:::tip

We recommend using [Single Factor Auth](./sfa) and [MPC Core Kit](./mpc-core-kit) products for the
best user experience, in wallet integrations.

## Web3Auth for dApps

Web3Auth enables dApps to create customized authentication and wallet flows, giving you full control
over the user experience. Instead of relying on external wallets and complex blockchain terminology
that can confuse users, you can build streamlined flows tailored to your application's needs.
Web3Auth lets you either create an embedded wallet all within your application.

#### Key Benefits

- **Seamless User Experience** - Familiar web2-style login flows with no blockchain knowledge
  required
- **Complete Brand Control** - Customize the entire authentication experience to match your app
- **Built-in Embedded Wallet** - Focus on your app features while we handle wallet management,
  including pre-built wallet UI, fiat on-ramps, and other wallet services
- **Multi-Chain Support** - Deploy your app on any blockchain with our chain-agnostic architecture
- **In-App Transactions** - Enable users to interact with your app without leaving the interface
- **Flexible Integration** - Choose between embedded wallets or connect with external ones

:::tip

We recommend using [Plug and Play](./pnp) and [Single Factor Auth](./sfa) products for the best
all-round experience for dApp developers.

## Relationship between Web3Auth SDK and Integrating dApp/ Wallet

When a user logs in with a login provider like Google, it sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This
JWT token is sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function. The Web3Auth SDK will then validate the JWT
token with the set parameters in the Web3Auth Dashboard and accordingly generate a private key, in a
self-custodial way, resulting in easy onboarding for your user to the application.
