Choosing the right Web3Auth product involves a careful analysis of what each option offers. Both our Plug and Play and Core-Kit solutions have unique
features and benefits tailored to meet specific project needs.

:::caution Pre Planning Product Requirements

This document helps you understand the differences between the products and helps you make the right choice for your project. This is a very important
step in the Web3Auth Integration process, please make sure you're making the right choice for your project. **We would recommend you to the SDKs in
the same stack of products within Web3Auth to minimize the migration efforts.**

If you're considering using the Core Kit Multi Factor SDKs in the future and want a quick integration to start of, we recommend you to use the Single
Factor Auth SDKs right now and then move to the Multi Factor SDKs later. This will help you minimize the migration efforts from Plug and Play to Core
Kit.

In a case, where you have already integrated Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs and want to move to Core Kit, we recommend you to read our
[Troubleshooting Document around Key Migrations](/troubleshooting/different-private-key#migrating-between-sdks).

## Plug and Play

Web3Auth's **Plug and Play** is designed for efficiency and ease of use, offering predefined UI & UX flows and user-friendly SDKs.

**Key Features:**

- **Ease of Integration:** Requires only the initialization of the Web3Auth SDKs and the setup of necessary configurations.
- **Non Custodial:** By default, the SDKs are non-custodial, meaning that users have complete control over their wallets.
- **Pre Generated UX/UI Flows:** For ease of integration, this SDK offers predefined UI/UX flow, with full whitelabeling options.
- **Wallet Aggregator:** Allows you to integrate multiple existing wallets into your application, alongside social logins, to provide users with a
  seamless login experience of their choice.
- **Platform Compatibility:** Available for Web, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity and Unreal environments.

## Core-Kit

The **Core-Kit** provides a more hands-on approach. It allows developers to define and develop their authentication flows, with Web3Auth being
invisible to the end-user.

**Key Features:**

- **Customizable UI & UX:** Enables you to build and maintain your own UI & UX for login and MFA.
- **Owning the Infrastructure:** Enables you to own the wallet management and the authentication flow.
- **No Redirection:** Unlike PnP, for Core Kit the wallet management flows are not hosted on `app.openlogin.com`. This means that users will not be
  redirected to a different domain for authentication. All the flows can happen within your application.
- **Platform Compatibility:** Available for Web, React Native, iOS and Android.
