This guide provides an overview of various SDKs built by our partners, leveraging the capabilities of Web3Auth. The integrations serve as an ideal
starting point, offering insights into how Web3Auth harmonizes with diverse user experiences.

## Account Abstraction SDKs

Account Abstraction (AA) represents a groundbreaking shift in Web3 authentication methods, redefining how decentralized applications (dApps) are
designed and interacted with today.

- **Unified Self-Custody:** AA streamlines the process by merging externally-owned accounts (EOAs) and smart contracts, leading to the emergence of
  self-custodial wallets, further bolstered by heightened security measures.

- **Ecosystem Evolution:** At its foundation, the ERC-4337 proposal champions the adaptation and enhancement of AA within the Ethereum network. The
  broader vision encompasses achieving complete account abstraction across the ecosystem, an aspiration long-held.

- **Decentralized Integrity:** Central to ERC-4337 is its commitment to censorship resistance. Thanks to account abstraction, there's no compromise on
  decentralization, a challenge that has been elusive for a long time.

Incorporating Multi-Party Computation (MPC) amplifies the capabilities of account abstraction. Through the dispersion of transaction validation across
multiple parties, MPC ensures that no single participant holds undue influence over a transaction. The marriage of this robust security mechanism with
the intuitiveness of account abstraction delivers an unparalleled dual benefit. Furthermore, Web3Auth's functionality of granting account access via
social logins and augmenting account recovery amplifies user convenience in account access and management.

Web3Auth is leading this change, and many top software kits use it. By mixing our knowledge in MPC with AA, we make sure our decentralized apps are
strong and easy to use.

### Biconomy SDK

A pioneer in leveraging EIP4337 and gas abstraction, the Biconomy SDK is built firmly on the ERC4337 solution, offering a full spectrum of tools
tailored for dApps. It enhances the dApp user experience in a non-custodial manner. Key features include:

- Seamless user onboarding with social login, account setup & recovery.
- An in-dApp fiat gateway for buying/selling crypto.
- Gasless transactions, allowing dApps to cover gas fees.
- Paying gas fees using ERC20 tokens.
- Custom transaction bundling to streamline multiple operations.
