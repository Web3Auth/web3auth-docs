title: Verifiers (Logins)

also called authenticators.

CustomAuth deploys a custom Verifier Script for your application on the Torus
Network. Verifier Scripts determine the access structure to your users keys and
the set Verifier Scripts chosen determine which logins your application will
ultimately use. You can read more about verifiers
[here](https://medium.com/toruslabs/key-assignments-resolution-and-retrieval-afb984500612).

## Supported Logins

Known logins or attestation methods that can be chosen include OAuths and custom
logins methods:

| Attestation/Login Method | Lookups | VerifierID Case-sensitive |
| :----------------------- | :------ | :------------------------ |
| Google OAuth2            | Y       | N                         |
| Reddit OAuth2            | Y       | N                         |
| Discord OAuth2           | Y       | Y                         |
| Twitch OAuth2            | N       | Y                         |
| Facebook OAuth2          | N       | Y                         |
| Apple \(Proxy\)          | N       | Y                         |
| Github \(Proxy\)         | Y       | N                         |
| Linkedin \(Proxy\)       | N       | Y                         |
| Weibo \(Proxy\)          | Y       | N                         |
| Twitter \(Proxy\)        | Y       | N                         |
| Line \(Proxy\)           | N       | Y                         |
| Auth0 login              | Depends | Depends                   |
| AWS Cognito              | Depends | Depends                   |
| Custom JWT logins        | Depends | Depends                   |
| Custom ECDSA logins      | Depends | Depends                   |

There are some nuances with certain login providers, so don't hesitate to get in
touch to get further details.

## Aggregating Logins/Verifiers

It is possible to combine these attestation methods in AND/OR ways. For example
you could combine a Google AND Reddit login to access a key. this vice versa can
be done for Google OR Reddit. For these aggregate verifiers, its important to
note that a user's verifierID must be known ahead of time, as keys in Torus are
append only. Meaning to assign to a key to a user with the aggregate verifier
Google OR Reddit, I must know the users gmail account and reddit account ahead
of time.

This disadvantage can be subverted if the two attestation methods share the same
verifierID. For example, Auth0 generic email logins OR Google logins both use
email accounts as the verifierID, as such the verifierID can me shared amonst
the two. This is referred to as a Single ID Verifier.

get your aggregate verifier deployed on our testnet.

## Using your own custom login provider

You can use your own login provider's with Torus, using one of the custom login
schemes \(either via JWTs or ECDSA signatures\). This way, your users can still
use your existing login provider, with CustomAuth. As long as your application
follows the JWT specification and uses JWKS for signing whose public keys are
exposed by an endpoint, it should be supported.

## Can XXXX authenticator/login be supported?

The list isn't comprehensive to all the logins that the Torus system is capable
of supporting, if you'd like support for a particular login system do send your
query over to hello@tor.us.
