title: Redirects & Service Workers
---

## OAuth Redirect

Redirect URLs are a critical part of the OAuth flow. After a user successfully
authorizes an application, the authorization server will redirect the user back
to the application with either access/ id token in the URL. Because the redirect
URL will contain sensitive information, it is critical that the developer only
whitelists authorized URLs with the OAuth provider.

In torus direct auth, we require the query and hash params present in the
redirect url to retrieve the user data.

## Web

In
[customauth](https://github.com/torusresearch/customauth),
there are two ways to serve the redirect url

### Using service workers

A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate
from a web page. We can use service workers to capture the redirected url and
serve a html page. The code present in the html communicates the query and hash
params to the underlying torus sdk which finishes the login process.

To use service workers, you need to serve the sw.js \(present in
`customauth` npm package\) from the baseUrl of your website \(eg: if
`https://example.com/serviceworker/redirect` is your redirect uri, baseUrl would
be `https://example.com/serviceworker`\)

### Using hosted `redirect.html`

[Some browsers](https://caniuse.com/serviceworkers) don't support service
workers. For those browsers, you need to serve redirect.html \(present in
`customauth` npm package\) from the baseUrl as defined above.

If you're facing problems with redirect being stuck, please refer to
[FAQ section](faq.mdx#my-redirect-page-is-stuck-in-ios-chrome)

## Android \(and react-native android\)

In
[torus-direct-android-sdk](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-android-sdk),
please add mainfestPlaceholders in your build.gradle with the following
properties

```groovy
android.defaultConfig.manifestPlaceholders = [
  'torusRedirectScheme': 'YOUR_APP_SCHEME', // (torusapp)
  'torusRedirectHost': 'YOUR_APP_HOST', // (org.torusresearch.torusdirectandroid)
  'torusRedirectPathPrefix': 'YOUR_REDIRECT_PATH' // (/redirect)
]
```

At verifier's interface \(where you obtain client id\), please use
`browserRedirectUri` in DirectSdkArgs \(default:
[https://scripts.toruswallet.io/redirect.html](https://scripts.toruswallet.io/redirect.html)\)
as the redirect uri. If you specify a custom `browserRedirectUri`, pls host
[redirect.html](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-android-sdk/blob/master/torusdirect/src/main/java/org/torusresearch/torusdirect/activity/redirect.html)
\(present in the package\) at that url.
