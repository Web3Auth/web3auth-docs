Integrate CustomAuth into your applications today.

:::info

Register at [https://developer.tor.us][https://developer.tor.us) to
get your verifier spun up today!

:::

Try our hosted example [here](https://vue-direct.tor.us).

To allow your web app to retrieve keys from the Torus Network, we'll be using
the [custom-auth-sdk](https://github.com/torusresearch/customauth), the
repo itself has examples that you can also refer to:

1. Install the package `npm i @toruslabs/customauth`
2. Serve
   [service worker](https://github.com/torusresearch/customauth/blob/master/serviceworker/sw.js)
   from `baseUrl` where baseUrl is the one passed while instantiating
   `DirectWebSdk` for specific login \(example
   [http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/](http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/)\).
   If you're already using a sw, pls ensure to port over the fetch override from
   [our service worker](https://github.com/torusresearch/customauth/blob/master/serviceworker/sw.js)
3. For browsers where service workers are not supported or if you wish to not
   use service workers, create and serve
   [redirect page](https://github.com/torusresearch/customauth/blob/master/serviceworker/redirect.html)
   from `baseUrl/redirect` where baseUrl is the one passed while instantiating
   `DirectWebSdk` for specific login \( example
   [http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/](http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/)\)
4. At verifier's interface \(where you obtain client id\), please use
   `baseUrl/redirect` \(eg:
   [http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/redirect](http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/redirect)\)
   as the redirect_uri where baseUrl is the one passed while instantiating
   `DirectWebSdk`
5. Instantiate the package with your own specific client-id

```javascript
const torus = new DirectWebSdk({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/",
  proxyContractAddress: "0x4023d2a0D330bF11426B12C6144Cfb96B7fa6183", // details for test net
  network: "ropsten", // details for test net
});
await torus.init();
```

6. Trigger the login

```javascript
const userInfo = await torus.triggerLogin({
  typeOfLogin: "google",
  verifier: "MY VERIFIER NAME",
  clientId: "MY CLIENT ID GOOGLE",
});
```

If you're building a chrome extension or electron app, please set
`redirectToOpener: true` and modify the origin of postMessage from
`"http://localhost:3000"` to your hosted domain in redirect.html and sw.js.
\(This allows the popup to redirect to your app if the communication to opener
window fails\)

For integration into other mobile, native or other platforms please refer to
[Integrating CustomAuth](integrating-customauth/).

## Registration

Firstly, register your app with OAuth login providers. There are two types of
providers which Torus supports. Click on the links to see instructions on how to
configure OAuth provider.

- Native providers allow you to register your app directly with
  [implicit grant support ](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/)and use
  with Torus. The following are the supported native providers

  - [Google](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849)
  - [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps)
  - [Reddit](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/oauth2)
  - [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2)
  - [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/#registration)

  For native providers, please provide us with the client/app ID registered with
  the provider.

- Proxy providers require you to register your app on OAuth provider and add
  some config on their app. Proxy providers enable you to use some non-implicit
  type logins. \(e.g: Twitter, Apple, GitHub, LinkedIn, Email-Password, Magic
  link, WeChat etc.\) Some examples of proxy providers

  - [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/connections)
  - [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/social-login/)
  - [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/getting-started/)
  - or any custom OAuth2 compliant login provider

  For proxy providers, please provide us with the Client ID, Authentication
  domain provided by the proxy provider.
