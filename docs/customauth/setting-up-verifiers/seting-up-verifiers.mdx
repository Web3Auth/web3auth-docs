Here are the different kind of providers that we support:

- **Native Providers**

    Native providers allow you to register your app directly with
    [implicit grant support ](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/)and use them
    with Torus. The following are the supported native providers and instructions on how to set up an application with them.

    - [Google](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849)
    - [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps)
    - [Reddit](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/oauth2)
    - [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2)
    - [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/#registration)

  For native providers, you'll need the client ID / app ID to create a verifier.

- **Proxy providers**

  Proxy providers enable you to use some non-implicit type logins. \(e.g: Twitter, Apple, GitHub, LinkedIn, Email-Password, Magic
  link, WeChat etc.\) and require you to register an app with them.

  Some examples of proxy providers:

  - [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/connections)
  - [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/social-login/)
  - [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/getting-started/)
  - or any custom OAuth2 compliant login provider

  We support Auth0 out of the box. For others, you'll have to create a [custom verifier](custom-verifier).
