The password manager flow allows for a familiar login flow \(via Emails/Phone
Numbers\) on an application whilst utilising the users provided password as an
added salt on their public-private key pair.

Much like password managers \(eg. LastPass, BitWarden\), traditionally this
model takes your private key, encrypts it with your password, and stores this
encrypted private key on their servers. This ensures another layer of security
for the user since nobody can retrieve the private key unless they know the
password.

Combined with CustomAuth, we're able to replace the central server with Torus'
distributed architecture to allow us to make use of our distributed key
generation protocol to act as the initial randomness, which will be added to the
user's password to generate the user's private key.

The user's private key is the XOR of the distributed key generated by torus
nodes and a hash of the user's password. Meanwhile, the double hash of the
password is used to verify the user's identity with Torus.

However, this introduces a host of other problems, including the difficulty of
password recovery, password reset, device management, as well as the issue of
how to ensure that password recovery of their private keys isn't centralised or
censorable.
