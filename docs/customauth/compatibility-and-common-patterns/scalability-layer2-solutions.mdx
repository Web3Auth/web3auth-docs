If your application needs to handle a large amount of transactions, you may need
to consider implementing on a layer 2 solution.

CustomAuth is integrable with most \(if not all\) scalability solutions, no
matter the flavour. This includes, but is not limited to: Matic or other plasma
implementations, SKALE, Optimistic roll ups \(be it Arbitrium, Optimism or even
other chains\), state channels like Connext or even PoA networks.

EthHub has a great
[write up ](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/state-channels/)of
the different flavours/options out there, and whilst its specific to Ethereum
many of the other techncial techniques are implemented on other chains.
