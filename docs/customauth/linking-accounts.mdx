title: Linking Accounts
---

CustomAuth supports the linking of user accounts from various identity
providers. This allows a user to authenticate from any of their accounts and
still be recognized by your app and associated with the same public/private key.

It is possible to link accounts via two methods; user initiated links between
accounts after login or via a common unique identifier across logins used.

## User Initiated Linking

This process of linking accounts merges two existing user profiles into a single
one. When linking accounts, a **primary login** and a **secondary login** must
be specified.

The way this works behind the scenes is we store the difference `nonce` between
the primary login key A and secondary key B on a self-hosted/public storage
layer \(e.g. IPFS with a cached server\) for future retrieval.

When next time when the user logs into his/her secondary login he/she
reconstructs `privKeyA` through the sum of `nonce` and `privKeyB`

```typescript
// Connecting Login A with Login B
privKeyA - privKeyB = nonce

// We store nonce on storage layer
// Next time a user logs in with Login B
privKeyA = privKeyB + nonce

```

### Suggesting users to account link

You can find accounts with the same email, and prompt the users to link them.
For example, a user can create an account with Google with the user@gmail.com,
and then log in with Facebook, with an account linked to the same email.

If that occurs, you can show users the list of available accounts so they can
link them, by first authenticating with the account they will be linking to.

## Common Unique Identifier

Several logins in CustomAuth have common datafields for users. For example,
Google and traditional email logins share that they use email accounts to
identify a user. Take a look at
[Supported Logins](verifiers#supported-logins) for more
details here.

We can automatically join accounts here via Aggregate Logins. There are some
nuances here when considering how to join users, and mostly joins other than
email are not recommended.
