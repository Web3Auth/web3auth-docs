Design a key management architecture that suites your user base.

Depending on your application's platform we have different SDKs for integrating
CustomAuth:

- [WebSDK in Javascript](https://github.com/torusresearch/customauth)
- [Android in Java SDK](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-android-sdk)
- [IOS Swift SDK](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-swift-sdk)
- [Native SDK in Java](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-utils-java)
- [React Native Sdk in Javascript](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-react-native-sdk)

These SDKs implement interactions with the Torus Network which are detailed more
closely
[here](https://medium.com/toruslabs/key-assignments-resolution-and-retrieval-afb984500612)
and
[here](../../key-infrastructure/system-architecture#verifiers-and-key-retrieval).
Each of the SDKs go into further detail with exact implementation details and
example code within their readme's.

The steps for integration are:

1. **[Designing your key management architecture](designing-your-key-management-architecture):** decide on which logins (verifiers) you'd like to implement, your authentication structure
and more

2. **Deploying to testnet & implement**: once you've designed your key management architecture
for your app we can deploy your app-specific verifier scripts on the
Torus Network. This is done by submitting an append only transaction that
creates the verifier scripts. These are highly limited in updatability thus most applications to test out the
deployed scripts on testnet first. Once deployed, the application can then access and use these verifier scripts
via one or more of our SDKs.

3. **Deploying to mainnet**: and finally once before entering production be sure to convert/deploy your verifier to mainnet [all deployments are done on the developer dashboard](https://developer.tor.us)
