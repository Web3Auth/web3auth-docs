## Understanding Adapters

In the Web SDK, we have adapters, which are essentially connectors between Web3Auth and the underlying wallet provider. For example, an adapter for
connecting with torus wallet is available under web3auth as [@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter).
Every adapter follows a common interface which is required by Web3Auth to communicate with the wallet.

Adapter is a pluggable package which implements `IAdapter` interface for a wallet. An adapter can be plugged in and out of web3auth modal. An adapter
emits certain events like `CONNECTED`, `CONNECTING` and `DISCONNECTED` etc during login lifecycle of a user. Each adapter exposes provider on
successful user login which can be used to invoke RPC calls on wallet and on connected blockchain.

Hence, adapters are needed to connect your Web3Auth instance to a wallet provider. Web3Auth by default contains a pre-configured list of login
adapters. It also provides flexibility to add/remove adapters or to use some existing adapter with custom configurations. To configure an adapter
create an instance of the adapter by using its corresponding package and pass the returned adapter instance in the `configureAdapter` function.

For example, to configure openlogin adapter,

- Import the `OpenloginAdapter` from the `@web3auth/openlogin-adapter` package.
- Create an instance of the adapter along with the configuration
- Pass the returned instance to `web3auth.configureAdapter` as shown in the example below.

```ts
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter";

const openloginAdapter = await OpenloginAdapter({
  adapterSettings: {
    network: "testnet",
    clientId: "example-client-id",
    uxMode: "popup",
  },
  loginSettings: {
    relogin: true,
  },
});

web3auth.configureAdapter(openloginAdapter);
```

## Currently Available Adapters

---

By default Web3Auth's modal UI supports a set of default adapters depending on the `authMode` being used. By default, Web3Auth requires basic
configuration `client_id`, and registering a redirect if you are using CustomAuth adapter from the dashboard.

The table below summarizes all the available adapters and their properties

### Types of Wallet Adapters

Currently Web3Auth supports two categories of wallet adapters:

- `IN_APP` Application Wallets
- `EXTERNAL` External Wallets

#### Application Wallets

- Application wallets are those wallets which are scoped to dApp. This means that if you are logging in with the same application wallet on different
  applications, you will get different wallets (private keys).
- `openlogin`, `torus-evm` and `torus-solana` are Application Wallets.

#### External Wallets

- External wallet are those which are global for all applications. No matter where you are logging in, you will get same keys if same credentials are
  being provided.
- `metamask`, `phantom` and `walletconnect-v1` are External Wallets in Web3Auth.
