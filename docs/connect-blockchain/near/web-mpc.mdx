To sign the transactions for Near using MPC CoreKit JS SDK, you can utilize the
@toruslabs/tss-frost-lib to instantiate `Web3AuthMPCCoreKit` with ed25519 KeyType. To support the
ed25519 curve Web3Auth internally uses the FROST algorithm to provide the EdDSA sginature using
threshold protocols.

This EdDSA signature can be used to submit the transactions on Near blockchain.

## Installation

To interact with the Near blockchain, you can use
[near-api-js](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/quick-reference) package with Web3Auth CoreKit
SDK along with [@toruslabs/tss-frost-lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@toruslabs/tss-frost-lib)
package.

```bash npm2yarn
$ npm install near-api-js
$ npm install @toruslabs/tss-frost-lib
```

## Initializing and instantiating the Web3Auth MPC CoreKit JS SDK

<Initialization />

## Get User Info

Gives you the user's information received from the ID Token.

```tsx
const userInfo = coreKitInstance?.getUserInfo();
```

## Get account

Once you have an `Web3AuthMPCCoreKit` instance, it can be used as along with `near-api-js` package.

To generate the Near implicit address, you can use the `getPubKeyEd25519` method to retrieve the
ed25519 curve compatible pubKey. Once you have the pubkey, you can create `PublicKey` instance, and
retrive the implicit address which is basically hex of `PublicKey`.

```tsx
import { PublicKey } from "near-api-js/lib/utils";
import { KeyType } from "near-api-js/lib/utils/key_pair";

const coreKitPubKey = coreKitInstance.getPubKeyEd25519();
const publicKey = new PublicKey({ keyType: KeyType.ED25519, data: coreKitPubKey });

const address = Buffer.from(this.publicKey.data).toString("hex");
```

## Get account balance

To get the user's balance, we can use the `JsonRpcProvider.query` method, which takes `request_type`
as an parameter. For `request_type` we gonna pass `view_account` as an argument. The `view_account`
RPC method enables you to view details about account.

```tsx
import { JsonRpcProvider } from "near-api-js/lib/providers";
import { AccountView } from "@near-js/types/lib/provider/response";

try {
  const state = await this.jsonRPCProvider.query<AccountView>({
    request_type: "view_account",
    account_id: this.getAccount(),
    finality: "optimistic",
  });

  const balance = state.amount;
} catch (error) {
  if (error.type === "AccountDoesNotExist") {
    // Account has no funds and it does not exist. Please add funds to the account
  }

  // Handle error
}
```

## Sign a message

Signing a message for Near is pretty straight forward. You can simply use the `sign` method to
generate the EdDSA signature.

```tsx
const msg = Buffer.from("Welcome to Web3Auth");
const sig = await this.coreKitInstance.sign(msg);
```

## Sign a transaction

To sign a Near transaction, you can use `Transaction` class to get a buffer of the transaction data
to sign, and use the generated signature to create `SignedTransaction`.

Before we create a Near blockchain transaction, let's implement `getAccessKey`. We'll use the
`JsonRpcProvider.query` method, and pass `view_access_key` as an argument for `request_type`. The
`view_access_key` RPC method returns the information about an account's access key such as nonce,
permission, along with block details which are used to create transaction.

```tsx
import { AccessKeyViewRaw } from "@near-js/types";

async getAccessKey(): Promise<AccessKeyViewRaw> {
    try {
        // Use the jsonRPCProvider, address, and publicKey defined early.
        const acessKey = await jsonRPCProvider.query<AccessKeyViewRaw>({
            request_type: "view_access_key",
            account_id: address,
            finality: 'optimistic',
            public_key: publicKey.toString(),
        });

        return acessKey;

    } catch (e) {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

Once we have implemented `getAccessKey`, we can create the transaction using `createTransaction`
helper method.

```tsx
import {
  Signature,
  SignedTransaction,
  createTransaction,
  encodeTransaction,
  transfer,
} from "near-api-js/lib/transaction";
import { AccessKeyViewRaw } from "@near-js/types";
import { base_decode } from "near-api-js/lib/utils/serialize";
import { sha256 } from "@noble/hashes/sha256";
import { base64 } from "@scure/base";
import { parseNearAmount } from "near-api-js/lib/utils/format";

// Defined above
const accessKey = await getAccessKey();
const nonce = accessKey.nonce + 1;

const block = await this.jsonRPCProvider.block({ finality: "final" });
const blockHash = block.header.hash;

const transaction = createTransaction(
  address,
  publicKey,
  "blackjaguar7625.testnet",
  nonce,
  [transfer(BigInt(parseNearAmount("0.02")!))],
  base_decode(blockHash),
);

const serializeTransaction = encodeTransaction(transaction);
const tssSignature = await this.coreKitInstance.sign(Buffer.from(sha256(serializeTransaction)));

const signature = new Signature({
  keyType: KeyType.ED25519,
  data: Uint8Array.from(tssSignature),
});
```

To broadcast the signed transaction, you can utilize the `JsonRpcProvider.sendTransaction` method.

```tsx
// transaction and signature are defined above
const executionDetails = await this.jsonRPCProvider.sendTransaction(
  new SignedTransaction({
    transaction,
    signature,
  }),
);

const hash = executionDetails.transaction.hash;
```
