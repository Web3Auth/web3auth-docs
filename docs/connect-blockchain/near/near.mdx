For Near integration, Web3Auth offers an `ed25519` private key specifically tailored for the Near
blockchain. This cryptographic key conforms to the standards required for secure authentication and
transaction signing on Near's network.

Integrating Web3Auth with Near is straightforward and efficient. Developers can leverage Web3Auth's
functionalities to establish secure connections with Near nodes, enabling seamless interaction with
the blockchain. This includes tasks such as submitting transactions, querying blockchain data, and
managing user authentication within Near-based applications.

With Web3Auth's native support for Near and the `ed25519` curve, developers can streamline their
development process and harness the full potential of blockchain technology within their Near-based
projects.

This documentation provides a straightforward guide for developers looking to implement Near
connection quickly and effortlessly across various platforms.
