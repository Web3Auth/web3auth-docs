Web3Auth is the frontend authentication system for your dApp. Once the user is authenticated, the
Web3Auth SDK returns a provider. A provider is how libraries like web3.js & ethers.js talk to the
blockchain. Providers take JSON-RPC requests and return the response. This is normally done by
submitting the request to an HTTP or IPC socket-based server. With Web3Auth, you get two types of
providers, depending on the product you use:

1. [Shamir Secret Sharing based Private Key Providers](#private-key-providers-pnp--sfa)
2. [Threshold Signature Scheme based MPC Providers](#mpc-core-kit-providers)

## Web3Auth is Chain Agnostic

By default, Web3Auth supports the `secp256k1` and `ed25519` key curves. While these key curves serve
the majority of blockchains out there, certain blockchains have different curve implementations of
their own. While for MPC Core Kit, you need dedicated providers to interact with certain
blockchains, with **Web3Auth PnP & SFA you can interact with any blockchain of your choice**.

In Web3Auth PnP & SFA, the ability to export the user's private key comes in handy. This private key
can be utilized by the dApp to interact with the chain.

You can read more about this in our [Connect with Other Blockchains](./other/) section.

Web3Auth is composable - you can combine it with meta-transaction flows, multisigs, and other
cryptographic protocols. It is easy to build on top of, and generally fits in with most other
technology stacks, including but not limited to; your favorite scalability solutions, meta
transactions, smart contract wallets, different elliptic curve pairs and even RSA.

## Private Key Providers (PnP & SFA)

The Private Key Providers work with the majority of Web3Auth products, including Plug and Play SDKs,
Single Factor Auth SDKs, and tKey SSS (v1) SDKs. As the name suggests these providers are a wrapper
around the user's private key, which is dynamically reconstructed with Shamir's Secret Sharing and
is present in the user's frontend.

Once the authentication happens, the returned result from the Web3Auth network is taken up by the
provider to give a common interface to interact with the blockchain of your choice. Currently,
Web3Auth supports the following private key providers for Web SDKs:

- [EIP1193 Private Key Provider](/sdk/pnp/web/providers/evm): For connecting to EVM based chains
- [Solana Private Key Provider](/sdk/pnp/web/providers/solana): For connecting with Solana
  Blockchain
- [XRPL Private Key Provider](/sdk/pnp/web/providers/xrpl): For connecting with XRPL Blockchain
- [Common Private Key Provider](/sdk/pnp/web/providers/common): For connecting with any blockchain.

## MPC Core Kit Providers

The Threshold Signature Scheme-based MPC Providers work with our MPC Core Kit SDK. These providers
generate a signature of the particular key curve the provider is configured for and accordingly
gives you the interface to initialize with the blockchain it is configured for. Currently, Web3Auth
MPC Core Kit supports the following providers:

- EIP1193 MPC Provider: For connecting with EVM-based chains
- EDDSA MPC Provider: For connecting with Solana and other chains that support the `ed25519` curve.
- Bitcoin MPC Provider

## Reference Guides for Blockchain Connections

You can check out the following guides we've written for certain blockchains. We have covered a wide
variety of EVM and EVM Chains, supported by multiple web3auth providers.

## Adding JSON RPC APIs

Web3Auth providers give you a standard way of interacting with the blockchain. However, alongside
that, it is recommended to use JSON RPC APIs, which help you connect to the blockchain without the
need to run your own instance/ nodes. There are many services which offer a web API for accessing
different blockchains:

#### Infura

[Infura](https://infura.io) is the leading platform for Ethereum infrastructure. It provides a
gateway to the Ethereum network, allowing developers to build and scale decentralized applications
without having to run their own infrastructure. Most of the Web3Auth backend infrastructure runs on
Infura APIs.

#### Quicknode

[Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/) is a managed blockchain node service that provides
high-performance access to 15+ blockchains, including Ethereum, Gnosis (xDAI), Polygon, Binance

Smart Chain, Avalanche, Fantom, Solana, Optimism, Arbitrum (+Nova), Algorand, Harmony, Celo, Neon,
Terra and Bitcoin networks. They're the biggest node providers for the Solana Ecosystem, and our
major partners for Solana infrastructure.

#### Alchemy

As a developer platform, [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) provides a suite of developer toolings
and abstractions including JSON RPC APIs across all major chains, an ethers.js SDK, and a library of
[enhanced APIs](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/enhanced-apis-overview) like their NFT APIs.

#### Ankr

[Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/) is a decentralized cloud computing platform that provides a full suite
of infrastructure services for blockchain developers. Most of the examples in our documentation use
Ankr's Public JSON RPC APIs, to help you kickstart.

#### dRPC

[dRPC](https://drpc.org) is a new type of RPC services, that combined 30+ RPC provider across the
globe in one computation pool, to provide best possible reliability and latency.

## Faucets for Different Blockchains

Faucets are services that provide users with a small amount of cryptocurrency for free. These are
often used for testing purposes or to onboard new users to a blockchain network. Here are some
popular faucet services for different test blockchains:
