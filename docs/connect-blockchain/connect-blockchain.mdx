Web3Auth is the frontend authentication system for your dApp. Once the user is authenticated, the Web3Auth SDK returns a provider. A provider is how
libraries like web3.js & ethers.js talk to the blockchain. Providers take JSON-RPC requests and return the response. This is normally done by
submitting the request to an HTTP or IPC socket-based server. With Web3Auth, you get two types of providers, depending upon the product you use:

1. [Shamir Secret Sharing based Private Key Providers](#private-key-providers-non-mpc)
2. [Threshold Signature Scheme based MPC Providers](#mpc-providers)

## Web3Auth is Chain Agnostic

By default Web3Auth supports the `secp256k1` and `ed25519` key curves. While these key curves serve the majority of blockchains out there, certain
blockchains have different curve implementations of their own. While for our MPC products, you need dedicated providers to interact with certain
blockchains, with **Web3Auth non MPC products you can interact with any blockchain of your choice**.

In Web3Auth non MPC Products, the ability to export the user's private key comes in handy. This private key can be utilised by the dApp to interact
with the chain.

You can read more about this in our [Connect with Other Blockchains](./other/) section.

:::info

Web3Auth is composable - you can combine it with meta-transaction flows, multisigs, and other cryptographic protocols. It is easy to build on top of,
and generally fits in with most other technology stacks, including but not limited to; your favorite scalability solutions, meta transactions, smart
contract wallets, different elliptic curve pairs and even RSA.

## Private Key Providers (non MPC)

The Private Key Providers work with the majority of Web3Auth products, including Plug and Play SDKs, Single Factor Auth SDKs, and tKey SSS (v1) SDKs.
As the name suggests these providers are a wrapper around the user's private key, which is dynamically reconstructed with Shamir's Secret Sharing and
is present in the user's frontend.

Once the authentication happens, the returned result from Web3Auth network is taken up by the provider to give a common interface to interact with the
blockchain of your choice. Currently, Web3Auth supports the following private key providers for Web SDKs:

- [EIP1193 Private Key Provider](/sdk/helper-sdks/providers/evm): For connecting to EVM based chains
- [Solana Private Key Provider](/sdk/helper-sdks/providers/solana): For connecting with Solana Blockchain
- [XRPL Private Key Provider](/sdk/helper-sdks/providers/xrpl): For connecting with XRPL Blockchain
- [Common Private Key Provider](/sdk/helper-sdks/providers/common): For connecting with any blockchain.

## MPC Providers

The Threshold Signature Scheme based MPC Providers work with our MPC Core Kit SDK. These providers generate a signature of the particular key curve
the provider is configured for and accordingly give you the interface to initialize with the blockchain it is configured for. Currently, Web3Auth MPC
Core Kit support the following providers:

- EIP1193 MPC Provider: For connecting with EVM based chains [Available by default within the SDK]
- Bitcoin MPC Provider (coming soon)
- Solana MPC Provider (coming soon)

## Reference Guides for Blockchain Connections

You can checkout the following guides we've written for certain blockchains. We have covered a wide variety of EVM and non EVM Chains, supported by
multiple web3auth providers.

## Adding JSON RPC APIs

Web3Auth providers give you a standard way of interacting with the blockchain. However, alongside that, it is recommended to use JSON RPC APIs, which
help you connect to the blockchain without the need to run your own instance/ nodes. There are many services which offer a web API for accessing
different blockchains:

#### Infura

[Infura](https://infura.io) is the leading platform for Ethereum infrastructure. It provides a gateway to the Ethereum network, allowing developers to
build and scale decentralized applications without having to run their own infrastructure. Most of the Web3Auth backend infrastructure runs on Infura
APIs.

#### Quicknode

[Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/) is a managed blockchain node service that provides high-performance access to 15+ blockchains, including
Ethereum, Gnosis (xDAI), Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Fantom, Solana, Optimism, Arbitrum (+Nova), Algorand, Harmony, Celo, Terra and
Bitcoin networks. They're the biggest node providers for the Solana Ecosystem, and our major partners for Solana infrastructure.

#### Alchemy

As a developer platform, [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) provides a suite of developer toolings and abstractions including JSON RPC APIs across
all major chains, an ethers.js SDK, and a library of [enhanced APIs](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/enhanced-apis-overview) like their NFT APIs.

#### Ankr

[Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/) is a decentralized cloud computing platform that provides a full suite of infrastructure services for blockchain
developers. Most of the examples in our documentation use Ankr's Public JSON RPC APIs, to help you kickstart.
