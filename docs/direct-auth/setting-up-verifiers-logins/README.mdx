title: Setting Up Verifiers/Logins
---

Firstly, register your app with OAuth login providers. There are two types of
providers which Torus supports. Click on the links to see instructions on how to
configure OAuth provider.

- Native providers allow you to register your app directly with
  [implicit grant support ](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/)and use
  with Torus. The following are the supported native providers

  - [Google](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849)
  - [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps)
  - [Reddit](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/oauth2)
  - [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2)
  - [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/#registration)

  For native providers, please provide us with the client/app ID registered with
  the provider.

- Proxy providers require you to register your app on OAuth provider and add
  some config on their app. Proxy providers enable you to use some non-implicit
  type logins. \(e.g: Twitter, Apple, GitHub, LinkedIn, Email-Password, Magic
  link, WeChat etc.\) Some examples of proxy providers

  - [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/connections)
  - [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/social-login/)
  - [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/getting-started/)
  - or any custom OAuth2 compliant login provider

  For proxy providers, please provide us with the Client ID, Authentication
  domain provided by the proxy provider.
