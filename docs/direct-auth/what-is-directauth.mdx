Distributed Key Generation as a Service

---

**Applications can directly interact with the**
[**Torus Network**](../how-torus-works/system-architecture.md) **to assign,
store and retrieve keys on the network - Distributed Key Generation as a
Service**. The integration is compatible with both web/native apps, applications
get access to the OAuth scopes provided to them \(name/email from Google\) and
there are no longer pop-ups - applications literally own the UX and can
implement their own permissions structure.

**Using DirectAuth allows you to manage an app-specific private key for your
users, while storing it in the distributed Torus Network.** You can see a demo
of this on the Torus Wallet**.** The fundamental flow for Torus sign-in is as
follows:

Just as how the Torus Wallet has a verifier script for each of the
authentication methods, this integration includes a deployment of a verifier
script on the BFT layer that the nodes share for the application specifically.
Keys which are generated through the DKG protocol are assigned to the verifier
script, which shares are respectively retrieved through successful execution of
the script. Whilst most integrations integrate different OAuths, the script is
generalisable and can be used to combine multiple OAuths, signatures and other
varied forms of attestation for a user. A list of verifiers can be found
[here](supported-authenticators-verifiers.md).

## What does this mean for my application?

Using DirectAuth allows you to manage an app-specific private key for your
users, while storing it in the distributed Torus Network. It allows you to
control the user experience and interface for all user interactions, without
having to rely on the Torus Wallet interface for user confirmations via popups.
