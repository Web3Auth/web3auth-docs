title: Integrating DirectAuth
---

Design a key management architecture that suites your user base.

---

Depending on your application's platform we have different SDKs for integrating
DirectAuth:

- [WebSDK in Javascript](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-web-sdk)
- [Android in Java SDK](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-android-sdk)
- [IOS Swift SDK](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-swift-sdk)
- [Native SDK in Java](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-utils-java)
- [React Native Sdk in Javascript](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-react-native-sdk)

These SDKs implement interactions with the Torus Network which are detailed more
closely
[here](https://medium.com/toruslabs/key-assignments-resolution-and-retrieval-afb984500612)
and
[here](../../how-torus-works/system-architecture.md#verifiers-and-key-retrieval).
Each of the SDKs go into further detail with exact implementation details and
example code within their readme's.

The steps for integration are:

1. [Designing your key management architecture](./#designing-your-key-management-architecture)
2. [Deploying to testnet](deploying-on-the-torus-network)
3. [Deploying to mainnet](deploying-on-the-torus-network)

Reach out to hello@tor.us or our [dev chat](https://t.me/torusdev) to get a
test-net spun up to play with today or get started with
[Designing Your Key Management Architecture](designing-your-key-management-architecture).
