## Key Assignments

The keys are assigned to a combination of `verifier` \(e.g., Google, Reddit,
Discord\) and `verifier_id` \(e.g., email, username\), which is a unique
identifier respective to and provided by the `verifier`.‌ This assignment can be
triggered by any node and is decided through the nodes consensus layer.

## Verifiers and Key Retrieval

The fundamental flow for Torus sign-in is as follows:

![Standard login with OAuth2 (Google, Facebook, Apple, Reddit, Discord, Twitch)](/contents/image&#32;(5).png)

1. Your application gets the user to sign-in via their preferred method \(OAuth
   / email password / passwordless / verification code\).
2. After the user gives consent/verifies his/her email, Torus SDK will receive an
   ID token and assign a key to the user depending on User Verifier ID from ID
   Token.
3. The key is retrieved from the Torus network and exposed to Web3 provider
   \(DApp\) to complete user sign-in request.
4. Torus uses this ID Token to check if the user’s profile information exists in
   the DApp.
   1. If it does, the user will be signed in to the DApp with their preferred
      login.
   2. If it doesn’t, the user can create a new account on the DApp with their
      preferred login.

In order to allow for general verifiers to be used instead of only allowing
OAuth, we typically need at least two of these APIs to be implemented by the
external verifier:‌

1. an API that issues unique tokens when a user is logged in.
2. an API that consumes these tokens and returns user information as well as
   when the token was issued.

The first API must be accessible from the browser \(e.g. CORS-enabled,
restricted headers\), in order to ensure that the Torus servers are not able to
intercept the user's token \(front-running\).

Typically any entity that fulfills these two APIs and provides signatures on
unique ID strings and timestamp can be a verifier. This is extendable to several
authentication schemes, including existing authentication standards like OAuth
Token flow and OpenID Connect.‌

**Front-Running Protection**

In order to prevent a rogue node, or the Torus servers, from front-running you
by taking your token, impersonating your login, and thereby stealing your key,
we use a commitment scheme on our token similar to Bracha's Reliable Broadcast,
to ensure that all nodes can be sure that a threshold number of other nodes are
aware of the commitment, before it is finally revealed.‌

The general approach is as follows: we ensure that the front-end gets access to
the token first, creates a commitment to the token and a temporary
public-private keypair, and reveals the token only if a threshold number of
nodes accept this commitment. The nodes will then use this keypair to encrypt
the shares before sending it to the user.

This is done by generating a temporary public-private keypair in the front-end.
The front-end calls the first API and receives an authentication token. This
token is hashed, and the front-end sends the token hash and the temporary public
key to each node, and each node returns a signature on this message, if this is
the first time they have seen this token commitment. A bundle of these
signatures is the proof, and submitting the proof together with the plain
\(unhashed token\) to each node results in the node responding with a key share
that is encrypted with the temporary public key.

**Attack 1: Front-runner intercepts the original commitment request and sends a
modified public key**

In this case, the user will not receive a threshold number of signatures, and
thus will not reveal their token. They will then be required to login again and
request for a new token. Since the requests to the nodes are made in a random
order, eventually a threshold honest set can be reached before a front-runner
receives the commitment request.

**Attack 2: Front-runner intercepts the reveal request and resends it to other
nodes**

Since a public key is already associated with the token in the commitment
request, nodes will only respond with encrypted shares. Even if a front-runner
intercepts the encrypted shares, they will be unable to decrypt it.
