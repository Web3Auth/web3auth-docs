While setting up a new web3 project from scratch, you might face multiple issues the bundler. This issue is caused due to the fact that the core
packages like `eccrypto` have certain dependencies, which are not present within the build environment. For rectifying this, the go to method has been
to just add the missing modules directly into the package, and edit the bundler configuration to take advantage of that.

Although this method works, but it increases the bundle size significantly. Causing slow loading speeds and a bad user experience. It is important to
note that these modules, even while the build fails, are still present within the browser environment. Many libraries like Web3Auth are written in a
way so as to take advantage of this fact. Hence, even if the build doesn't contain the polyfill, the library should still work as expected. However,
if you are using a library which does not take advantage of this fact, you might face issues while using the library.

Hence, you need to be mindful of the fact that you only require certain node polyfills to be added to your project, while testing each of it's
functionalities. At the same time, you need to tell the bundler to ignore the missing modules, and not include them in the build.

In this guide, we have added instructions of adding the polyfills in Vite:

## Install the missing modules

Check for the missing libraries in your build and included packages, and accordingly polyfill them. For Web3Auth, you just need to polyfill the
`buffer` and `process` libraries. For the rest of the libraries, we are installing a dummy module called `empty-module` which helps us get rid of the
warnings while building the project.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev buffer process empty-module
```

:::caution

There might be a possibility that you might need to polyfill more libraries, in case you're using any other blockchain library alongside Web3Auth that
requires them. Generally the libraries like `crypto-browserify`, `stream-browserify`, `browserify-zlib`, `assert`, `stream-http`, `https-browserify`,
`os-browserify`, `url` are the ones that might be required. `crypto-browserify` and `stream-browserify` being the most common polyfills.

## Update your `vite.config.js`

To make use of the polyfilled modules while building the application, you need to reconfigure your vite config.

```tsx
/* eslint-disable import/no-extraneous-dependencies */
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      crypto: "empty-module",
      assert: "empty-module",
      http: "empty-module",
      https: "empty-module",
      os: "empty-module",
      url: "empty-module",
      zlib: "empty-module",
      stream: "empty-module",
      _stream_duplex: "empty-module",
      _stream_passthrough: "empty-module",
      _stream_readable: "empty-module",
      _stream_writable: "empty-module",
      _stream_transform: "empty-module",
    },
  },
  define: {
    global: "globalThis",
  },
});
```

## Fixing additional dependency issues

Update the `index.html` file to include the polyfills. As shown in the code snippet below we added the `<script>` tag to include the polyfills.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!--highlight-start-->
    <script type="module">
      import { Buffer } from "buffer";
      import process from "process";
      window.Buffer = Buffer;
      window.process = process;
    </script>
    <!--highlight-end-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
