:::caution

Your JWT token header must contain the `kid` field and the payload data must contain `iat` field.

:::

While setting up Web3Auth's Custom Authentication, there might be cases you would be getting JWT errors. Here's the list of those and steps to fix it.

- [Invalid JWT Verifiers ID field](#invalid-jwt-verifiers-id-field)
  - Error occurred while verifying params could not verify identity
- [Failed to verify JWS signature](#failed-to-verify-jws-signature)
  - Error occurred while verifying params unable to verify jwt token
- [Duplicate Token](#duplicate-token)
  - Could not get result from torus nodes Duplicate token found
- [Expired Token](#expired-token)
  - Error occurred while verifying paramstimesigned is more than 1m0s ago
- [Mismatch JWT Validation field](#mismatch-jwt-validation-field)

## Invalid `JWT Verifiers ID` field.

### Error occurred while verifying params could not verify identity

---

"Error occurred while verifying params could not verify identity" error could be because the `verifierIdField` of `extraLoginOptions` is different
from the one you have set up during the creation of Verifiers (`JWT Verifiers ID`) on the Web3Auth dashboard.

- This is the `JWT Verifiers ID` field on the `Verifier Modal` of the Web3Auth dashboard.
  <img style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "200px", marginBottom: "20px" }} src={JWTVerifierID} alt="JWT Verifier ID - Troubleshoot" />
- Make sure, this matched with your code.

  ```js
  import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

  await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
    loginProvider: "jwt",
    extraLoginOptions: {
      domain: "YOUR-PROVIDER-DOMAIN",
      verifierIdField: "sub", // <-- This is the JWT Verifiers ID field.
      response_type: "token",
      scope: "email profile openid",
    },
  });
  ```

## Failed to verify JWS signature.

---

### Error occurred while verifying params unable to verify jwt token

"Error occurred while verifying params unable to verify jwt token" error could be because of the following reasons:

- The verifier for your OpenLoginAdapter might be wrong. Check to make sure the `verifier` field is set correctly.
- The JWT is not signed with the correct key(JWK).
- The JWKS endpoint is not reachable or doesn't return a valid JWK that was used to sign the JWT.
- The JWKS endpoint is incorrect on the Web3Auth Dashboard. Double check to confirm the correct JWKS endpoint.
  <img style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "200px", marginBottom: "20px" }} src={JWKSEndpoint} alt="JWKS Endpoint Field - Troubleshoot" />
- The JWKS is missing the `kid` field.
- The `kid` present in the JWT header is not present in the JWKS.

`sample jsks`:

```js
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "RSA",
      "e": "AQAB",
      "use": "sig",
      "kid": "YOUR-KID", // <-- This is the kid.
      "n": "YOUR-N",
      "alg": "RS256" // <-- This is the algorithm.
    }
  ]
}
```

`sample jsks endpoint`: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs

## Duplicate token

---

### Could not get result from torus nodes Duplicate token found

- "Could not get result from torus nodes Duplicate token found" error is thrown when the JWT is sent twice in the same request.

  ```js
  await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
    loginProvider: "jwt",
    extraLoginOptions: {
      id_token: "ID_TOKEN", // <-- JWT should be unique for each request.
      domain: "https://YOUR-PROVIDER-DOMAIN",
      verifierIdField: "sub",
    },
  });
  ```

## Expired token

---

### Error occurred while verifying paramstimesigned is more than 1m0s ago

:::caution

Web3Auth accepts only those JWTs whose `iat` is less than the current time and is not greater than `60s` from current time. Regardless of the `exp`
feild of the JWT.

- In short, the JWT is considered expired if the `iat` is greater than `60s` from current time.

:::

"Error occurred while verifying paramstimesigned is more than 1m0s ago 2022-02-24 13:46:05 +0000 UTC" error could be because:

- JWT is expired.
- The JWT's `exp` field is less than the current time.
- The JWT's `iat` field is greater than `60s` from current time.

## Mismatch JWT Validation field

---

This error occurred when the validation field in the JWT is not matching with the validation field entered during the creation of Verifiers on the
Web3Auth dashboard.

- This is the `JWT Validation` field on the `Verifier Modal` of the Web3Auth configuration.
  <img style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "200px", marginBottom: "20px" }} src={JWTValidation} alt="JWT Validation Field - Troubleshoot" />
- Make sure, these feilds are present in the JWT Payload and matches with the JWT.
