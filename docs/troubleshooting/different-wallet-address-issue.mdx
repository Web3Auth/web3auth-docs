:::note

Web3Auth accounts are scoped to applications (`Client ID`).

:::

### Getting the different wallet address on different applications.

The following are the list of reasons it could be happening:

- Different verifiers are being used in different applications.
- Different client ids are being used
- Different social logins (Email passwordless and Google login are not the same)
- Torus wallet accounts could be different from web3auth accounts.

### While creating dApps with Web3Auth getting different wallet address after some time while using the same account to login.

The following are the list of reasons it could be happening:

- Make sure to use your project's client id
- Double check the verifiers details
- Different social logins are used (Email passwordless and Google login are not the same)
