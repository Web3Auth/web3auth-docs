Currently Web3Auth supports two types of users :-

1. Users who login using Social Logins
2. Users who login using External Wallets

As a dApp you might want to authenticate a Web3Auth user in your backend. Generally the authentication happens over a JWT token.

Web3Auth provides a mechanism to get a JWT token for both the social login users as well as the external wallet users.
