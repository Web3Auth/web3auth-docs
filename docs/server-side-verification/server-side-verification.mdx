Currently Web3Auth supports two types of users :-

1. Users who login using Social Logins
2. Users who login using External Wallets

As a dApp you might want to authenticate a Web3Auth user in your backend. Generally the authentication happens over a JWT token.

Web3Auth provides a mechanism to get a JWT token for both the social login users as well as the external wallet users.

In the next sections, we will help you understand how to get the JWT token and also how to verify it on your backend resources.
