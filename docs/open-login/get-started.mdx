OpenLogin is a plug n play auth suite that combines the simplicity of passwordless authentication with the security of
non-custodial public key infrastructure (PKI). It brings the ease of passwordless, SSO, biometric authentication to any native
mobile or web applications and results in a cryptographic key pair specific to user and application.
