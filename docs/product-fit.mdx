---

Deciding on the right product for your needs can often be a critical part of ensuring the success of
your launch. If you're considering Web3Auth for your project, the following qualifying questions
will help you understand which of our products best fits your requirements.

Choosing the right Web3Auth product involves a careful analysis of what each option offers.

:::warning Pre Planning Product Requirements

This document helps you understand the differences between the products and helps you make the right
choice for your project. This is a very important step in the Web3Auth Integration process, please
make sure you're making the right choice for your project. **We would recommend you to the SDKs in
the same stack of products within Web3Auth to minimize the migration efforts.**

:::

## Choosing the Right SDK

- **Plug and Play SDKs** are designed for quick, easy integration, offering a predefined UI/UX
  suitable for projects with speed as a priority.

- **Core-Kit SDKs** provide a customizable and hands-on approach for developers who want full
  control over the UI/UX and authentication flows, ideal for enterprises and in-depth
  customizations.

:::tip

If you're considering using the **Core Kit Multi Factor Auth SDKs** in the future and want a quick
integration to start off, we recommend you use the Single Factor Auth SDKs right now and then move
to the Multi Factor Auth SDKs later. This will help you minimize the migration efforts from Plug and
Play to Core Kit.

In a case, where you have already integrated Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs and want to move to Core
Kit, we recommend you read our
[Troubleshooting Document around Key Migrations](/troubleshooting/different-private-key#migrating-between-sdks).

Choosing the right Web3Auth product is key to a successful project launch. The following qualifying
questions aim to guide you through the decision-making process. They cater to diverse project
requirements and explore various key considerations. By reflecting on these questions, you'll be
better equipped to make an informed decision that ensures your selected Web3Auth product aligns
seamlessly with your needs, laying a solid foundation for your project's success.

We've divided the questions into the following categories:

- [Basic Product Questions](#basic-product-questionaire)
- [UI/ UX Questions](#ui-ux-questions)
- [Infrastructure Questions](#infrastructure-questions)
- [SSS vs MPC Questions](#sss-vs-mpc-questions)

## Basic Product Questionaire

### What are you building? A dApp or a Wallet?

- If you're building a Wallet, our Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs can provide a quick and effective
  solution, although a better user experience for a wallet might come from our Core Kit SDKs, where
  Web3Auth is hidden. You just need to put in additional engineering efforts to build the UX flows.
  You can switch between any of our SDKs in the future, however, it is important to consider you're
  choosing the right configuration for the future migration to be easier.

  :::

- If you're building a dApp any of our products can be useful, however, with Web3Auth PnP or Core
  Kit Solutions, you would need to manage the UX Flows and Interoperability yourself. Plug and Play
  can be quite useful as it contains some pre-made flows to make the integration easier. Torus
  Wallet is a great integration too, but it is an independent wallet, so any of the UX flows will
  not be in your control.

  :::

### What chain are you building on?

- The good news is that Web3Auth is chain agnostic. That means you can build on any chain you
  prefer. We support `SECP256K1` and `ED25519` key curves out of the box, and with private key
  manipulation, one can connect any chain. There are specialized providers for EVM, Solana and XRPL.
- Wallet Ecosystems are available across specific chains, please read across their particular
  integrations.

### What platform are you using?

- Plug and Play SDKs support Web, Mobile (Android and iOS), Hybrid (React Native and Flutter) and
  Gaming (Unity and Unreal) environments.
- Core Kit SDKs support Web, Mobile (Android and iOS), and React Native environments.
- Wallet Ecosystems differ based on the specific Wallet Ecosystem's support and integration
  capabilities.

### What level of interoperability do you need?

- For a fully interoperable flow, use Wallet Ecosystems products which give you exception
  interoperability features across their own ecosystem and your dApp.

- Using Wallet Services, you can have your own PnP or Core Kit integration fully interoperable using
  Wallet Connect or any Wallet Ecosystem as well. use the Torus wallet in your application.

## UI/ UX Questions

### Do you require a prebuilt UI/UX for Login/MFA?

- If you want a ready-made solution, use our Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs.
- If you prefer to craft your own UI/UX for your users, the Web3Auth Core-Kit SDKs are the way to
  go.
- Wallet Ecosystems offer a tailored integration with specific Wallet Ecosystems, leveraging their
  UI/UX.

### Do you need auto-signing?

- By auto-signing, we mean that the UX for approving the transaction is controlled by the
  application itself. This can only be done when the application has access to the private key/ user
  signature.
- Both Plug and Play SDKs and Core-Kit SDKs feature auto signing, removing the need for your users
  to approve each transaction.
- Wallet Ecosystems do not support auto-signing, as the user has to approve the transaction in the
  wallet itself.

## Infrastructure Questions

### Do you want to manage the MFA Infrastructure?

- If you'd like to maintain ownership of the MFA Infrastructure, our Core-Kit SDKs are the best
  choice for you.

### Do you want to manage the Login Infrastructure ie. use any existing Social Logins (e.g. Google, FB, etcâ€¦), or a passwordless login of your own?

- Both our Plug and Play and Core Kit SDKs allow you to manage your own Login Infrastructure. It is
  a feature called Custom Authentication in Plug and Play SDKs and a requirement for Core Kit SDKs.
- Wallet Ecosystems do not support managing the login infrastructure, as they rely on the Wallet
  Ecosystem's authentication mechanisms.

### Do you want to customize the storage and threshold of the user key shares?

- The Web3Auth Plug and Play SDK gives you the standard way of storing the user key shares. If you
  want to customize the storage of the user key shares, you can use our Core Kit SDKs.
- With Core Kit SDKs, you can customize the threshold and the number of shares required to recover
  the user key. You can also customize the storage of the user key shares. From Device share storage
  to Social Recovery, QR backups, Email Backups, Database encrypted storage etc. you can choose the
  flow you want to use.
- Wallet Ecosystems do not support customizing the storage and threshold of the user key shares, as
  they rely on the Wallet Ecosystem's protocols and tools.

## SSS vs MPC Questions

### Do you want the user key to be present on the application frontend?

- If you're looking to keep the user key in the frontend, our traditional SDKs, powered by Shamir's
  Secret Sharing Scheme, can be a good choice for you.
- If you prefer to keep the user's keys divided the whole time and only have a temporary sign
  generated when the user is signing, our new SDKs, powered by the Threshold Signature Scheme, are
  the way to go.

### Do you want to import keys from other wallets?

- If you want to import keys from other wallets, you can use our Core Kit SDKs.
- The Core Kit SDKs have the option of key import, however, it has the trade-off of key generation
  integrity. This is because to maintain noncustodiality, we make sure that the key imported is
  encrypted by the Web3Auth generated key, and stored on the metadata server. It is not possible to
  directly import a key and distribute it into multiple parts within the Shamir Secret Sharing
  infrastructure.
- The best place to import keys can be the MPC Infrastructure. With the import key API in our MPC
  SDKs, it is possible to import up to 4 keys directly into the MPC infrastructure. However, as you
  import multiple keys, the user interaction tends to become slower.

### Do you want your user to be able to export their key?

- If you want your users to be able to export their key, you can any of our SDKs.
- With SSS-based SDKs, the key is reconstructed on every login, so the user can export the key at
  any point in time.
- With MPC-based SDKs, the key reconstruction never happens, hence the process of exporting the key
  is a bit more complex. Exports can be done via an open-source external script that can be locally
  run. Alternatively, weâ€™re in the midst of developing a simple binary that could be operated to
  combine the factors.
