---

This guide will help you understand which of our products best fits your requirements.

:::warning Pre Planning Product Requirements

Carefully evaluate the differences between products before integration. **We recommend using SDKs
within the same Web3Auth product stack between different platforms, to ensure the user account
remains the same across platforms.**

:::

## Choosing the Right SDK

- **Plug and Play SDKs** are designed for quick, easy integration, offering a predefined UI/UX
  suitable for projects with speed as a priority.

- **Single Factor Auth SDKs** provide a streamlined authentication experience with a single social
  login, ideal for applications prioritizing simplicity and quick user onboarding.

- **MPC Core Kit SDKs** offer advanced security through multi-party computation, giving developers
  complete control over authentication flows and wallet management, perfect for enterprise
  applications requiring high security.
