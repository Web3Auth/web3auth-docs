Hit your mainstream audience by abstracting all the hussle and bussle on your
application, whilst staying non-custodial

Depending on your applications needs, Torus can be integrated via the
[Torus Wallet](torus-wallet/quick-start.md), or through interacting directly
with the Torus Network via [DirectAuth](direct-auth/what-is-directauth.md).

### [Torus Wallet integration](torus-wallet/quick-start.md)

The Torus Wallet allows any application to seamlessly support their user's
interactions with Ethereum \(and similar EVM chains\). It comes with a prebuilt
UI, OAuth logins, fiat-to-crypto, whitelabel and much more listed in the
[features section](torus-wallet/features/).

If your application is already compatible with Metamask/other web3 providers,
integrating the Torus Wallet would give you a provider to wrap the same web3
interface. You can install via a
[npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@toruslabs/torus-embed) or
[ipfs](torus-wallet/quick-start.md#ipfs). or
[jsdelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@toruslabs/torus-embed) or
[unpkg](https://unpkg.com/@toruslabs/torus-embed) More
[details](torus-wallet/quick-start.md)

### [DirectAuth integration](direct-auth/quick-start.md)

Applications can directly interact with the Torus Network to assign, store and
retrieve keys on the network - Distributed Key Generation as a Service. Whilst
abstracting key management from your application, the integration is compatible
with both web/native apps, blockchain agnostic, and there are no longer any
pop-ups - your application will be in full control of the permissions flow. More
[information](direct-auth/what-is-directauth.md)

If you're looking to control your own UX, from logins to every interaction
DirectAuth is the integration for you. You can
[integrate](direct-auth/integrating-directauth/) via one of our SDKs depending
on the platform/s you are building on.
