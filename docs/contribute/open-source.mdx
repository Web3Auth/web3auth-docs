We have an ongoing bug bounty program for **security-related bugs that compromise key security**. This is generally only applicable for
[openlogin.com](https://openlogin.com), [https://app.tor.us](https://app.tor.us), and (tKey)[https://github.com/tkey/tkey].

The tiers are as follows:

- Critical \($10,000\) - Bugs that allow theft of user keys under normal operating conditions
  - Eg. Ability to access private key from the dapp JS context
- High \($5000\) - Bugs that restrict user access to keys, cause loss of funds, system failure, or theft of user keys under restricted operating
  conditions.
  - Eg. Ability to reset a user's account to a new private key so they are unable to access their funds
- Medium \($800\) - Bugs that affect user access, cause service downtime, or affect usability of the system
  - Eg. Restricting logins for users so they are unable to access their wallet at certain times
- Low \($200\) - Bugs that do not directly compromise security but have the potential to affect users adversely and cause loss of funds
  - Eg. Spoofing authentication emails, presenting wrong information on the wallet

In order to ensure that your bug report is valid and has not already been reported, please reach out to hello@tor.us directly.
