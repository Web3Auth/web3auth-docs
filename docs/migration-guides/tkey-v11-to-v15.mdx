title: Migration Guide from v11 to v15 for tKey CoreKit JS SDK
description: "tKey CoreKit Web SDK - v11 to v15 | Documentation - Web3Auth"
sidebar_label: v11 to v15
---

## Overview

This migration guide provides steps for upgrading from version v11 to v15 of the Web3Auth tKey
CoreKit Web SDK. The guide outlines significant changes and enhancements, including the support of
`ed25519` curve. This guide also mentions about different Service Providers you can use with your
tKey integration, including a newly introduced SFA Service Provider.

## Breaking Changes

### ThresholdKey renaming

In v15, the `ThresholdKey` import is reanmed to `TKey` in the `@tkey/core` package.

```tsx
// focus-start
// remove-start
import ThresholdKey from "@tkey/core";

const tKey = new ThresholdKey({
// remove-end

// add-start
import { TKey } from "@tkey/core";

const tKey = new TKey({
// add-end
// focus-end
  serviceProvider,
  storageLayer: storageLayer,
  modules: {
    webStorage: webStorageModule,
    shareSerialization,
  },
});
```

While in `@tkey/default` package the `ThresholdKey` has been renamed to `TkeyDefault`.

```tsx
// focus-start
// remove-start
import ThresholdKey from "@tkey/default";

const tKey = new ThresholdKey({
// remove-end

// add-start
import { TKeyDefault } from "@tkey/default";

const tKey = new TKeyDefault({
// add-end
// focus-end
  modules: {
    webStorage: webStorageModule,
    securityQuestions: securityQuestionsModule,
  },
  customAuthArgs: {
    web3AuthClientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID",
    baseUrl: `${window.location.origin}/serviceworker`,
    network: TORUS_SAPPHIRE_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
  },
});
```

### `privKey` is now renamed to `secp256k1Key`

The `privKey` getter in `TKey` which used to return the secp256k1 curve private key is now renamed
to `secp256k1Key`.

```tsx
//remove-next-line
const privateKey = tKey.privKey?.toString("hex");
//add-next-line
const privateKey = tKey.secp256k1Key?.toString("hex");
```

Similar to `TKey`, the `privKey` in `ReconstructedKeyResult` is now renamed to `secp256k1Key`.

```tsx
const reconstructedKey = await tKey.reconstructKey();

//remove-next-line
const privateKey = reconstructedKey?.privKey.toString("hex");
//add-next-line
const privateKey = reconstructedKey?.secp256k1Key.toString("hex");
```

## Additional `ed25519` Support

We are happy to announce that with v15, tKey will natively support the `ed25519` curve. Starting
from v15, developers can use the tKey with the Blockchain ecosystem which uses the `ed25519` curve.

:::warning

Please note, this is a native support for `ed25519` curve in tKey SDK, unlike the previous
integrations where, using the `openlogin-ed25519` package, a sub key was derived for supporting the
curve.

If you are already using the `openlogin-ed25519` package for your application, please do not upgrade
to this method as **it might cause the keys to change** for existing users.

For new integrations, we recommend using this new flow of native support for `ed25519` curve.

:::

```tsx
const tKey = new TKey({
  serviceProvider,
  storageLayer: storageLayer,
  modules: {
    webStorage: webStorageModule,
    shareSerialization,
  },
});

// focus-start
// Get the ed25519 seed once the tKey is reconstructed
// highlight-next-line
const seed = await tKey.retrieveEd25519Seed();

// Use the seed with any ed25519 curve blockchain to retrive public key, and sign
// the transactions.
// focus-end
```

## Addition of SFA Service Provider

As part of the broader updates to the tKey SDK, one of the key changes we've introduced is the
Single Factor Auth Service Provider. This update simplifies the authentication process by reducing
complexity and decreasing package size, making it the preferred option for most use cases.

### Previous Default: Torus Service Provider

The Torus Service Provider was previously the default service provider in tKey SDK, offering both
implicit logins and ID token-based logins. While feature-rich, the Torus Service Provider introduced
a level of complexity that could make integration challenging, particularly for developers who
didn't need both login flows. Additionally, the package size was larger due to its extended
functionality.

### New Introduction: SFA Service Provider

The new Single Factor Auth (SFA) Service Provider simplifies the authentication flow by focusing
solely on ID token-based authentication. The authentication interface closely resembles our Single
Factor Auth SDKs, reducing integration complexity. It additionally cuts down the package size, and
gives you more control over your authentication logic.

- What it Offers: Only ID token-based authentication (no implicit login flow).
- Why Use It: Simplified integration and smaller package size.
- Recommendation: We recommend migrating to the SFA Service Provider unless you specifically require
  implicit login flows.

:::info

Our default documentation is now updated to reflect the SFA Service Provider as the default option.
If you are using `@tkey/default` package it is still using Torus Service Provider behind the scenes.
You can still find our documentation for Torus Service Provider in the
[implicit flow docs](/sdk/infra/tkey/implicit-flow)

:::

:::warning update to sfa service provider is not mandatory

Any migration to SFA Service provider is **not required**. This addition is to provide more options
and make integration less complex for new users. Both the service providers will be maintained and
supported.
