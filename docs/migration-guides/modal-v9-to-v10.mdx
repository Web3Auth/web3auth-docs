# Web3Auth PnP Web SDK v10 Migration Guide

This guide will help you upgrade your Web3Auth PnP SDK integration from v9 (whether you were using
the Modal or the `@web3auth/no-modal` SDK) to the **unified Web3Auth PnP Web SDK v10**.

Version 10 significantly simplifies your Web3Auth integration by consolidating into a single
powerful SDK. It centralizes configuration in the Web3Auth Developer Dashboard and removes the
complexity of managing separate adapters, connections (previously verifiers), and manual blockchain
configuration from your frontend code. React integrations now exclusively use a hooks-based
approach. Direct connections (for developers implementing a custom UI, a capability previously
prominent in the No-Modal SDK) are now seamlessly available within this unified Modal SDK. Now, our
web SDK is divided into three parts:

- `@web3auth/modal/react` - The Web SDK for React
- `@web3auth/modal/vue` - The Web SDK for Vue
- `@web3auth/modal` - The Web SDK for JS for any frontend library or framework using vanilla JS

## Why these changes?

Web3Auth v9 provided developers with distinct SDKs for modal and non-modal integrations, offering
targeted solutions and flexibility. As the Web3 landscape evolves and to further enhance the
developer experience, Web3Auth v10 introduces significant refinements aimed at simplifying common
integration patterns, reducing boilerplate, and centralizing configuration.

Building on the foundation of v9, key areas of evolution in v10 include:

- **A Unified & Versatile SDK (`@web3auth/modal`):** To offer greater versatility and simplify the
  initial SDK choice, v10 consolidates all functionalities into a single `@web3auth/modal` SDK. This
  powerful SDK allows developers to seamlessly implement pre-built modal UIs or create custom user
  interfaces with direct connections to authentication providers, all using one consistent API.
- **Dashboard-Centric Configuration:** Many configurations, such as login methods, connection
  details (formerly verifiers), Smart Account settings, and chain specifics, are now managed through
  the Web3Auth Developer Dashboard. This shift centralizes control, reduces client-side code, and
  makes updates across projects more straightforward.
- **Streamlined Login & Connection Management:** V10 moves towards a more declarative approach.
  Manual client-side adapter registration and configuration are minimized, with login methods
  primarily defined on the dashboard and client-side connection calls becoming more direct and
  intuitive.
- **Automated Blockchain Setup:** For standard blockchains, v10 reduces the need for manual
  `chainConfig` and `privateKeyProvider` setup in the client by handling these configurations
  automatically based on your dashboard settings.
- **Integrated Smart Account Functionality:** Smart Account integration is now more cohesive. The
  primary configuration is managed on the dashboard, and the functionality is built directly into
  the main SDK, removing the need for a separate Smart Account provider package for most common use
  cases.
- **Simplified Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA setup is streamlined, with key settings now
  configured directly during SDK initialization.
- **Modernized React Experience:** For React applications, v10 fully embraces a hooks-based
  architecture, with the `Web3AuthProvider` automatically handling SDK initialization for a cleaner
  development workflow.

The result is a cleaner, more declarative, and more maintainable integration experienceâ€”especially
for teams maintaining apps across multiple auth flows and chains, all using one SDK.

## Installation

Install the latest v10 unified SDK package. Depending on your framework, you'll primarily use one of
the following:

- **React:** `npm install @web3auth/modal @web3auth/modal/react` (or just `@web3auth/modal/react`
  which should pull in `@web3auth/modal` as a peer dependency)
- **Vue:** `npm install @web3auth/modal @web3auth/modal/vue` (or just `@web3auth/modal/vue`)
- **Vanilla JS / Other Frameworks:** `npm install @web3auth/modal`

```bash
# For React and Vue, you can use @web3auth/modal/react and @web3auth/modal/vue respectively.
npm install @web3auth/modal
```

Remove deprecated and now-consolidated packages if present:

- `@web3auth/no-modal` (if migrating from v9 No-Modal)
- `@web3auth/base`
- `@web3auth/auth-adapter` (especially if used for custom social auth config on client-side)
- `@web3auth/account-abstraction-provider`
- `@web3auth/ethereum-provider` (and other specific chain providers if you were using them directly
  with Web3Auth initialization for standard EVM chains)
- `@web3auth/modal-react-hooks` (for React users)
- `@web3auth/modal-vue-composables` (for Vue users)

:::warning Important

Ensure these packages are fully removed to avoid unexpected behavior and to leverage the unified v10
architecture.

:::

## General Migration Points (Applicable to All Frameworks)

### 1. Centralized Chain Configuration

Previously (v9), you often had to pass `chainConfig` (sometimes with `getEvmChainConfig`) and an
instance of a `privateKeyProvider` (like `EthereumPrivateKeyProvider`) during SDK initialization.

**In v10, chain configurations for standard EVM chains and passing of private key providers are not
needed anymore. You will be able to switch chains in your dapp among the chains you've toggled on
from the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).**

![Chains on Dashboard](https://i.ibb.co/4nCD2GTJ/chains.gif)

This means the `chainConfig` and `privateKeyProvider` properties in `Web3AuthOptions` are not needed
for v10 if you're using standard chains configured on your dashboard.

You can also add custom chains on the dashboard and use them in your dapp.

### 2. Whitelabeling and UI Customization Simplified

Whitelabeling and UI customization have been significantly streamlined in v10, focusing on dashboard
configurations and a more direct approach to modal customization.

- **1. Branding (v9 `uiConfig`): Moves to Dashboard**

  - Most general branding settings previously in the client-side `uiConfig` (e.g., `appName`,
    `logoLight`, `logoDark`, `theme` colors) are **now primarily configured on the
    [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io)**.
    ![Branding customizations on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/whitelabel/modal/branding.gif)
  - **Action:** Transfer v9 `uiConfig` branding to the dashboard. Client-side `uiConfig` in v10
    `Web3AuthOptions` is minimal, for overrides not covered by the dashboard.

- **2. Modal Login Method Display (v9 `modalConfig` in `initModal()`): New Structure in
  `Web3AuthOptions`**

  - **Previously (v9):** Customizing which login methods appear in the modal (and their
    appearance/order) was done via `modalConfig` in `initModal()` in v9.
  - **Now (v10):** This moves to `modalConfig` within `Web3AuthOptions` (at SDK instantiation). The
    structure is new, utilizing `connectors` (e.g., `WALLET_CONNECTORS.AUTH` for social/email,
    `WALLET_CONNECTORS.WALLET` for external wallets) and a `loginMethods` object within each
    connector.
  - Each login method (e.g., `google`, `email_passwordless`, `metamask`) is an object conforming to
    `LoginMethodConfig`, allowing you to set `name`, `showOnModal`, `authConnectionId` (for custom
    auth), etc.
    ```typescript
    // v10: modalConfig in Web3AuthOptions
    const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
      // ... other options
      modalConfig: {
        connectors: {
          [WALLET_CONNECTORS.AUTH]: {
            /* ... config for social/email ... */
          },
          [WALLET_CONNECTORS.WALLET]: {
            /* ... config for external wallets ... */
          },
        },
      },
    };
    ```
  - **Action:** Rebuild your modal display logic using the new `modalConfig` structure in
    `Web3AuthOptions`. Refer to the v10 `LoginMethodConfig` type definition for all properties.
    Deprecated v9 `WALLET_ADAPTERS` enum is replaced by `WALLET_CONNECTORS` and specific login
    method keys.

- **3. Auth Adapter Whitelabeling in v9: No longer supported**
  - In v9, `whiteLabel` settings in an `@web3auth/auth-adapter` instance could customize
    intermediate auth screens (e.g., social login pop-ups).
  - **In v10, passing this `whiteLabel` configuration is no longer supported since there is no way
    to configure auth adapter settings.**
  - **Action:** Remove v9 `AuthAdapter` `whiteLabel` configurations. Ensure your dashboard branding
    is comprehensive.

This shift centralizes UI control on the dashboard and simplifies client-side SDK configuration for
whitelabeling.

### 3. Smart Account Functionality

- **Previously (v9):** Configuring the adapter required installing the
  `@web3auth/account-abstraction-provider` package and using the `AccountAbstractionProvider` to set
  up the bundler, paymaster, and Smart Account Provider.

  ```typescript
  import {
    AccountAbstractionProvider,
    SafeSmartAccount,
  } from "@web3auth/account-abstraction-provider";

  const chainConfig = {
    // Chain config
  };

  const accountAbstractionProvider = new AccountAbstractionProvider({
    config: {
      chainConfig,
      smartAccountInit: new SafeSmartAccount(),
      bundlerConfig: {
        // Get the pimlico API Key from dashboard.pimlico.io
        url: `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/11155111/rpc?apikey=${pimlicoAPIKey}`,
      },
    },
  });

  const web3auth = new Web3Auth({
    clientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID",
    web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
    privateKeyProvider,
    accountAbstractionProvider,
  });
  ```

- **Now (v10):** The `@web3auth/account-abstraction-provider` has been deprecated. You can now
  enable Smart Accounts and configure the bundler and paymaster directly from the Web3Auth
  Dashboard. See Smart Accounts dashboard configuration, to learn more.
  [Web3Auth React Smart Accounts](/docs/sdk/web/react/advanced/smart-accounts)

      ![Smart Accounts Section](https://i.ibb.co/gZYNwVyy/smart-accounts.gif)

      If you want to override the Smart Account provider, bundler, paymaster, or paymaster context, you
      can now pass the custom configuration directly to Web3AuthOptions.

      ```typescript
      import { WEB3AUTH_NETWORK, Web3AuthOptions } from "@web3auth/modal";

      const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
        clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_DEVNET,
        // focus-start
        accountAbstractionConfig: {
          smartAccountType: "SMART_ACCOUNT_TYPE",
          chains: [
            {
              chainId: "0x1",
              bundlerConfig: {
                url: "YOUR_BUNDLER_URL",
                // This is just an example of how you can configure the paymaster context.
                // Please refer to the documentation of the paymaster you are using
                // to understand the required parameters.
                paymasterContext: {
                  token: "SUPPORTED_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS",
                  sponsorshipPolicyId: "sp_my_policy_id",
                },
              },
              paymasterConfig: {
                url: "YOUR_PAYMASTER_URL",
              },
            },
          ],
        },
        // focus-end
      };
      ```

### 4. Custom Authentication: From Verifiers to Connections

In v9, custom authentication, if one wanted to incorporate a self managed login then they made use
of `verifier` and `aggregate verifier` configurations for linking accounts from different social
providers to the same underlying user wallet (often based on a shared identifier like email).

In v10, this system is streamlined with "Connections" and "Grouped Connections" configured on the
Web3Auth Developer Dashboard, significantly reducing client-side code complexity.

**Key Changes & Mapping:**

1.  **Single Verifiers (v9) to Single Connections (v10):**

    - **In v9:** You defined a "Verifier" on the dashboard (e.g., for Google) and referenced its
      `verifier` name in your `AuthAdapter`'s `loginConfig` or when calling `connectTo`.
      ```typescript
      // v9: AuthAdapter with a single verifier
      const authAdapter = new AuthAdapter({
        adapterSettings: {
          loginConfig: {
            google: {
              verifier: "YOUR_GOOGLE_VERIFIER_NAME", // v9 verifier name
              typeOfLogin: "google",
              clientId: "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com",
            },
          },
        },
      });
      // OR when using connectTo:
      // await web3auth.connectTo("auth", {
      //   verifier: "YOUR_GOOGLE_VERIFIER_NAME",
      //   // ...
      // });
      ```
    - **In v10:** You create a "Connection" on the dashboard (e.g., for Google). This connection
      will have an `authConnectionId`. You use this `authConnectionId` in `modalConfig` (within
      `Web3AuthOptions`) to customize the modal, or directly with the `connectTo` method.

      ```typescript
      // v10: modalConfig with a single connection
      const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
        clientId: "YOUR_V10_CLIENT_ID",
        // ...
        modalConfig: {
          connectors: {
            [WALLET_CONNECTORS.AUTH]: {
              loginMethods: {
                google: {
                  name: "Google Login",
                  authConnectionId: "YOUR_GOOGLE_AUTH_CONNECTION_ID", // v10 connection ID
                },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      };

      // OR v10: connectTo with a single connection
      // await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_CONNECTORS.AUTH, {
      //   authConnection: AUTH_CONNECTION.GOOGLE,
      //   authConnectionId: "YOUR_GOOGLE_AUTH_CONNECTION_ID",
      // });
      ```

    - **Action:** Your existing v9 single verifiers will be automatically migrated to "Connections"
      on the new Web3Auth Developer Dashboard. Locate your migrated Connection, note its
      `authConnectionId`, and use this ID in your v10 client code (`modalConfig` or `connectTo`).
      Remove any v9 `AuthAdapter` configuration previously used for this verifier.

2.  **Aggregate Verifiers (v9) to Grouped Connections (v10):**

    - **In v9:** To link accounts from different providers (e.g., Google and a custom JWT, both
      using the same email) to the same wallet, you used an "Aggregate Verifier". This involved a
      main `verifier` name and a `verifierSubIdentifier` for each specific login method, where the
      sub-identifier typically mapped to a common field in the JWT (like `email`).
      ```typescript
      // v9: AuthAdapter with an aggregate verifier
      const authAdapter = new AuthAdapter({
        adapterSettings: {
          loginConfig: {
            google: {
              // Part of an aggregate verifier
              verifier: "MY_AGGREGATE_VERIFIER_NAME", // Main aggregate verifier name
              verifierSubIdentifier: "google-sub-verifier", // Specific sub-verifier for Google
              typeOfLogin: "google",
              clientId: "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com",
            },
            jwt_email: {
              // Another part of the same aggregate verifier
              verifier: "MY_AGGREGATE_VERIFIER_NAME",
              verifierSubIdentifier: "custom-jwt-sub-verifier",
              typeOfLogin: "jwt",
              clientId: "YOUR_CUSTOM_JWT_CLIENT_ID", // Not always applicable for JWT
              jwtParameters: {
                /* ... JWT specific params like domain, verifierIdField ... */
              },
            },
          },
        },
      });
      ```
    - **In v10:** You first create individual "Connections" on the dashboard for each auth provider
      (e.g., one for Google, one for your custom JWT). Then, you create a "Grouped Connection" on
      the dashboard, selecting the individual connections you want to group (e.g., group the Google
      and custom JWT connections). This Grouped Connection will have its own
      `groupedAuthConnectionId`. When a user logs in, you provide both the `groupedAuthConnectionId`
      and the specific `authConnectionId` of the login method being used. This allows Web3Auth to
      link accounts if the JWT from the chosen provider contains the same verifier ID field (e.g.,
      email) that the group is configured to use.

      ```typescript
      // v10: modalConfig with a grouped connection
      const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
        clientId: "YOUR_V10_CLIENT_ID",
        // ...
        modalConfig: {
          connectors: {
            [WALLET_CONNECTORS.AUTH]: {
              loginMethods: {
                google: {
                  name: "Google Login",
                  authConnectionId: "YOUR_INDIVIDUAL_GOOGLE_CONNECTION_ID", // ID of the individual Google connection
                  groupedAuthConnectionId: "YOUR_GROUPED_CONNECTION_ID_FROM_DASHBOARD", // ID of the group
                },
                myCustomJWT: {
                  name: "Login with Corp Email",
                  authConnectionId: "YOUR_INDIVIDUAL_CUSTOM_JWT_CONNECTION_ID",
                  groupedAuthConnectionId: "YOUR_GROUPED_CONNECTION_ID_FROM_DASHBOARD",
                },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      };

      // OR v10: connectTo with a grouped connection
      // For Google login part of the group:
      // await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_CONNECTORS.AUTH, {
      //   authConnection: AUTH_CONNECTION.GOOGLE,
      //   authConnectionId: "YOUR_INDIVIDUAL_GOOGLE_CONNECTION_ID",
      //   groupedAuthConnectionId: "YOUR_GROUPED_CONNECTION_ID_FROM_DASHBOARD",
      // });

      // For Custom JWT login part of the group:
      // const idToken = await getMyIdToken();
      // await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_CONNECTORS.AUTH, {
      //   authConnection: AUTH_CONNECTION.CUSTOM,
      //   idToken: idToken,
      //   authConnectionId: "YOUR_INDIVIDUAL_CUSTOM_JWT_CONNECTION_ID",
      //   groupedAuthConnectionId: "YOUR_GROUPED_CONNECTION_ID_FROM_DASHBOARD",
      // });
      ```

    - **Action:**
      1.  Your existing v9 Aggregate Verifiers (and their sub-verifiers) will be automatically
          migrated to the new v10 dashboard. They will appear as individual "Connections" that are
          part of a "Grouped Connection".
      2.  On the v10 dashboard, locate your migrated Grouped Connection. Note its
          `groupedAuthConnectionId`.
      3.  For each login method within that group, find the corresponding individual migrated
          Connection and note its specific `authConnectionId`.
      4.  Update your v10 client code to use both the `groupedAuthConnectionId` (for the group) and
          the specific `authConnectionId` (for the particular login method being invoked) in
          `modalConfig` or `connectTo` calls. The v9 `verifierSubIdentifier` is no longer used in
          the client.

**General Steps for Migration:**

1.  **Remove `@web3auth/auth-adapter`**: If it was primarily used for client-side custom auth
    configuration, this package is no longer needed for this purpose.
2.  **Verify Migrated Dashboard Configuration**: Log in to the new Web3Auth Developer Dashboard.
    Your v9 verifiers (single and aggregate) should be migrated and visible as "Connections" and
    "Grouped Connections".
    - Familiarize yourself with their new structure and ensure they reflect your intended setup.
    - Identify the `authConnectionId` for each individual Connection and the
      `groupedAuthConnectionId` for your Grouped Connections.
3.  **Update Client Code**: Modify your `Web3AuthOptions` (for `modalConfig`) or `connectTo` calls
    to use the new `authConnectionId` and `groupedAuthConnectionId` obtained from your migrated
    dashboard configurations, as shown in the examples above.

This dashboard-centric approach, with automatic migration of existing verifiers, simplifies
client-side logic and provides a more robust way to manage authentication methods.

### 5. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA configuration has been streamlined. In v9, both `mfaLevel` and detailed factor configurations
(`mfaSettings`) were set within the `@web3auth/auth-adapter`. This has changed in v10.

- **Previously (v9):** MFA was configured via `AuthAdapter`: `loginSettings.mfaLevel` controlled the
  overall MFA experience, and `adapterSettings.mfaSettings` (with keys like `deviceShareFactor`)
  configured individual factors.

  ```typescript
  // v9: MFA configuration in AuthAdapter
  import { AuthAdapter } from "@web3auth/auth-adapter";

  const authAdapter = new AuthAdapter({
    loginSettings: {
      mfaLevel: "mandatory", // e.g., default, optional, mandatory, none
    },
    adapterSettings: {
      mfaSettings: {
        deviceShareFactor: { enable: true, priority: 1, mandatory: true },
        // ... other factors
      },
    },
  });
  ```

- **Now (v10) - Key Changes:**

  - **Individual MFA Factor Settings (`mfaSettings`):** Configuration of individual MFA factors
    (enabling, priority, mandatory status) moves from the v9 `AuthAdapter`'s
    `adapterSettings.mfaSettings` to the **`mfaSettings` object directly within `Web3AuthOptions`**
    (passed at SDK instantiation). The keys identifying MFA factors have also changed from
    descriptive string names (e.g., `deviceShareFactor`) to **enum values from `MFA_FACTOR`** (e.g.,
    `[MFA_FACTOR.DEVICE]`). If you previously configured individual factors, you must now transfer
    these settings to `Web3AuthOptions.mfaSettings` and update the factor keys.

    ```typescript
    // v10: mfaSettings in Web3AuthOptions
    import { MFA_FACTOR, WEB3AUTH_NETWORK, type Web3AuthOptions } from "@web3auth/modal";

    const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
      clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
      web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
      mfaSettings: {
        // Configure individual factors here
        [MFA_FACTOR.DEVICE]: {
          enable: true,
          priority: 1,
          mandatory: true,
        },
        [MFA_FACTOR.BACKUP_SHARE]: {
          enable: true,
          priority: 2,
          mandatory: true,
        },
        // ... other factors
      },
    };
    ```

  - **MFA Level (`mfaLevel`):** Setting `mfaLevel` via the v9 `AuthAdapter`'s `loginSettings` is
    **deprecated**. In v10, `mfaLevel` is specified as a parameter to the Web3AuthOptions object
    sent to the constructor.

    ```typescript
    // v10: mfaLevel in Web3AuthOptions
    import { MFA_LEVELS, WEB3AUTH_NETWORK, type Web3AuthOptions } from "@web3auth/modal";

    const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
      clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
      web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
      mfaLevel: MFA_LEVELS.MANDATORY,
    };
    ```

### 6. `useCoreKitKey` Renamed to `useSFAKey`

Note that the parameter `useCoreKitKey` (v9) has been renamed to `useSFAKey` (v10). This is a
breaking change if you were using it to get CoreKit keys. This parameter is part of the
`Web3AuthOptions` object.

```typescript
// v9: useCoreKitKey
const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
  useCoreKitKey: true,
};

// v10: useSFAKey
const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
  useSFAKey: true,
};
```

### 7. `authenticateUser()` Renamed to `getIdentityToken()`

In v9, the method `web3auth.authenticateUser()` was used to retrieve the user's ID token. In v10,
this method has been renamed to `web3auth.getIdentityToken()`.

The purpose and the structure of the returned ID token (a JWT containing user information) remain
the same. This is primarily a naming convention change.

```typescript
// v9: authenticateUser()
const userAuthInfo = await web3auth.authenticateUser();
const idTokenV9 = userAuthInfo.idToken;

// v10: getIdentityToken()
const userAuthInfoV10 = await web3auth.getIdentityToken(); // Returns { idToken: string }
const idTokenV10 = userAuthInfoV10.idToken;
```

## Migrating a React Application

This section focuses on changes specific to migrating a Web3Auth v9 React application to v10 using
`@web3auth/modal/react`.

### React Hooks Path and WalletServicesPlugin Updates

Previously, React hooks were at `@web3auth/modal-react-hooks`. Now, they are consolidated and
imported from `@web3auth/modal/react`. Even WalletServicesPlugin is now integrated into the hooks.
Previously, it was a separate package named `@web3auth/wallet-services-plugin-react-hooks`.

The `Web3AuthProvider` component remains essential for initializing the Web3Auth SDK and providing
its context. Key changes include:

- **Import Path**: `Web3AuthProvider` is imported from `@web3auth/modal/react`.
- **Configuration Prop**: `Web3AuthProvider` in v10 typically takes a single `config` prop. This
  `config` object (e.g., `web3AuthContextConfig`) will contain your `web3AuthOptions` and any
  client-side SDK configurations.
- **Dashboard Configuration**: Many configurations (like chain details for standard EVM chains, and
  verifier/connection settings) are now primarily managed through the Web3Auth Developer Dashboard.

**v10 `Web3AuthProvider` and Hook Usage:**

`Web3AuthProvider` is configured with a `config` object, and all hooks are streamlined under
`@web3auth/modal/react`.

```typescript title="main.tsx / index.tsx"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { Web3AuthProvider } from "@web3auth/modal/react"; // v10 import
import web3AuthContextConfig from "./web3authContext"; // see context file below
import App from "./App";

// Example with Wagmi, though not strictly necessary for Web3AuthProvider
import { WagmiProvider } from "@web3auth/modal/react/wagmi";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
const queryClient = new QueryClient();


ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <Web3AuthProvider config={web3AuthContextConfig}>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <WagmiProvider>
        <App />
      </WagmiProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </Web3AuthProvider>
);
```

```typescript title="web3authContext.ts"
import { WEB3AUTH_NETWORK, Web3AuthOptions } from "@web3auth/modal"; // v10 modal options
import { type Web3AuthContextConfig } from "@web3auth/modal/react"; // v10 context config type

const clientId = "YOUR_V10_CLIENT_ID"; // Get from https://dashboard.web3auth.io

const web3AuthContextConfig: Web3AuthContextConfig = {
  web3AuthOptions: {
    clientId,
    web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
  },
};

export default web3AuthContextConfig;
```

All hooks are now streamlined under `@web3auth/modal/react`:

```typescript title="App.tsx"
import {
  useWeb3Auth,
  useWeb3AuthConnect,
  useWeb3AuthDisconnect,
  useIdentityToken,
  useWeb3AuthUser,
  useSwitchChain,
  useEnableMFA,
  useManageMFA,
  useWalletConnectScanner, // Wallet Services
  useWalletUI, // Wallet Services
  useCheckout, // Wallet Services
  useSwap, // Wallet Services
  useWalletServicesPlugin, // Wallet Services
} from "@web3auth/modal/react";
```

The new hook structure is more granular:

- **Core Web3Auth:**
  - `useWeb3Auth`: Core hook for initialization status and overall SDK state.
- **Authentication:**
  - `useWeb3AuthConnect`: Handles connection.
  - `useWeb3AuthDisconnect`: Manages disconnection.
- **Identity:**
  - `useIdentityToken`: Retrieves identity tokens.
  - `useWeb3AuthUser`: Accesses authenticated user's information.
- **Blockchain:**
  - `useSwitchChain`: Allows switching networks.
- **MFA:**
  - `useEnableMFA`: Enables MFA.
  - `useManageMFA`: Manages MFA settings.
- **Wallet Services Plugin (now integrated):**
  - `useWalletServicesPlugin`: Hook to access the Wallet Services Plugin context.
    - `isPluginConnected`: `boolean`
    - `showWalletConnectScanner(params?)`: `Promise<void>`
    - `showCheckout(params?)`: `Promise<void>`
    - `showWalletUI(params?)`: `Promise<void>`
    - `showSwap(params?)`: `Promise<void>`

Refer to the [React Modal SDK Hooks documentation](/docs/sdk/web/react/hooks) for the detailed SDK
reference.

## Migrating a Vue Application

This section focuses on changes specific to migrating a Web3Auth v9 Vue application to v10 using
`@web3auth/modal/vue`.

### Vue Composables Path and WalletServicesPlugin Updates

Previously, Vue composables were at `@web3auth/modal-vue-composables`. Now, they are consolidated
and imported from `@web3auth/modal/vue`. WalletServicesPlugin functionality is also integrated into
these composables, whereas previously with v9 it was imported via
`@web3auth/wallet-services-plugin-vue-composables`.

**v10 Vue Composables Usage:**

All composables are now streamlined under `@web3auth/modal/vue`:

```typescript
import {
  useWeb3Auth,
  useWeb3AuthConnect,
  useWeb3AuthDisconnect,
  useIdentityToken,
  useWeb3AuthUser,
  useSwitchChain,
  useEnableMFA,
  useManageMFA,
  useWalletConnectScanner, // Wallet Services
  useWalletUI, // Wallet Services
  useCheckout, // Wallet Services
  useSwap, // Wallet Services
  useWalletServicesPlugin, // Wallet Services
} from "@web3auth/modal/vue";
```

The new composable structure is more granular:

- **Core Web3Auth:**
  - `useWeb3Auth`: Core composable for Web3Auth initialization and state management.
- **Authentication:**
  - `useWeb3AuthConnect`: Handles Web3Auth connection processes.
  - `useWeb3AuthDisconnect`: Manages disconnection from Web3Auth.
- **Identity:**
  - `useIdentityToken`: Retrieves and manages identity tokens.
  - `useWeb3AuthUser`: Provides access to the authenticated user's information.
- **Blockchain:**
  - `useSwitchChain`: Allows switching between different blockchain networks.
- **MFA:**
  - `useEnableMFA`: Enables Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
  - `useManageMFA`: Provides functionality to manage MFA settings.
- **Wallet Services Plugin (now integrated):**
  - `useWalletServicesPlugin`: Composable to access the Wallet Services Plugin context and its
    functions.
  - `useWalletConnectScanner`: Integrates WalletConnect scanner functionality.
  - `useWalletUI`: Manages wallet UI components and user interactions.
  - `useCheckout`: Facilitates cryptocurrency checkout processes.
  - `useSwap`: Enables token swapping capabilities.

Please refer to the [Vue Modal SDK documentation](/docs/sdk/web/vue/) for the SDK reference.

## Migrating a Vanilla JS or Angular (or other frameworks) Application

This section does not have any path changes. Please refer to the
[General Migration Points](#general-migration-points-applicable-to-all-frameworks) for the migration
points applicable to all frameworks.

### Wallet Services Plugin Integration

In v9, using Wallet Services (like Checkout, Swap, WalletConnect Scanner, or Embedded Wallet UI)
required importing the `@web3auth/wallet-services-plugin` package, instantiating
`WalletServicesPlugin`, and adding it to your Web3Auth instance via `web3auth.addPlugin()`.

**In v10, this integration is significantly streamlined:**

- The `@web3auth/wallet-services-plugin` package is **deprecated and should be removed**.
- Wallet Services functions are now **directly available as methods on the `web3auth` SDK instance**
  itself.

**Previously (v9):**

```javascript
import { Web3Auth } from "@web3auth/modal";
import { WalletServicesPlugin } from "@web3auth/wallet-services-plugin"; // v9 import

const web3auth = new Web3Auth({
  // ... your v9 Web3Auth options
});

const walletServicesPlugin = new WalletServicesPlugin({
  // ... wallet services plugin options
});
web3auth.addPlugin(walletServicesPlugin);

await web3auth.initModal();

// To show wallet UI:
// await walletServicesPlugin.showWalletUi();
// To show checkout:
// await walletServicesPlugin.showCheckout();
// etc.
```

**Now (v10):**

```javascript
import { Web3Auth } from "@web3auth/modal"; // v10 import

const web3auth = new Web3Auth({
  // ... your v10 Web3AuthOptions
  // No separate plugin initialization or adding needed for Wallet Services
});

await web3auth.init();

// To show wallet UI:
// await web3auth.showWalletUI();
// To show checkout:
// await web3auth.showCheckout({ /* options */ });
// To show swap:
// await web3auth.showSwap({ /* options */ });
// To show WalletConnect Scanner:
// await web3auth.showWalletConnectScanner();
```

Refer to the v10 documentation for a
[function overview](/docs/sdk/web/js/functions/#wallet-services-plugin-functions).
