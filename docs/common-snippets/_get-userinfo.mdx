Once logged in, Web3Auth instance returns you some information about your logged in user. This is fetched directly from the JWT token and Web3Auth
doesn't store this info anywhere. Hence, this information in available in social logins only after the user has logged into your application.

```js
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo(); // web3auth instance
```
