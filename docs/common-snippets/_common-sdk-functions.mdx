## `Display web3Auth modal and authenticate user`

So far we have successfully initialized `web3auth` sdk and subscribed to events.We just need to use `connect` function of `web3auth` instance to
display modal and we will be notified under our subscribed events on any user interaction with the modal.

Also after successful user login, web3auth instance will expose a provider under `web3auth.provider` which we will use interact with blockchain and
sign transactions.

```ts
const provider = await web3auth.connect();
```

<br />

:::info `web3auth.connect` will not return provider if you are using `redirect` uxMode with openlogin or customauth adapter. Pre configured openlogin
adapter package uses popup uxMode which will always return the provider. :::

<br />

## `Get authenticated user info`

Once user is connected you can get the information available for authenticated user by calling `getUserInfo` function.

```ts
const userInfo = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
```

<br />

:::info You will get different information about user based on the login method used by user. For ex: if user authenticates using social logins then
you will get name, email and profile image of user whereas if user is using some wallet like metamask to login then you will get only `ethereum`
address of user. :::

<br />

## `Logout`

At last we can also add function to logout user session. Calling `logout` function will disconnect user session and it will emit `DISCONNECTED` event
on successful disconnection on web3auth instance.

```ts
await web3auth.logout();
```
