## `Subscribe to Web3Auth lifecycle events`

We can get notified by various events during user's login session by subscribing to web3auth events. You can implement the logic of checking whether
user is logged in or not based on these events. Below is the code snippet for subscribing to web3auth events.

```ts
import { ADAPTER_EVENTS } from "@web3auth/base";
import { LOGIN_MODAL_EVENTS } from "@web3auth/ui";

function subscribeAuthEvents(web3auth: Web3Auth) {
  web3auth.on(ADAPTER_EVENTS.CONNECTED, (data: CONNECTED_EVENT_DATA) => {
    console.log("Yeah!, you are successfully logged in", data);
  });

  web3auth.on(ADAPTER_EVENTS.CONNECTING, () => {
    console.log("connecting");
  });

  web3auth.on(ADAPTER_EVENTS.DISCONNECTED, () => {
    console.log("disconnected");
  });

  web3auth.on(ADAPTER_EVENTS.ERRORED, (error) => {
    console.log("some error or user have cancelled login request", error);
  });

  web3auth.on(LOGIN_MODAL_EVENTS.MODAL_VISIBILITY, (isVisible) => {
    console.log("modal visibility", isVisible);
  });
}
```
