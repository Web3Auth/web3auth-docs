One of the most exciting features of Web3Auth is around its interoperability with Wallet Connect and Torus Wallet. This means that the private key
generated within your application with Web3Auth can be used to sign transactions within any application using Wallet Connect or Torus Wallet for their
login flow. This enables a dApp to choose if they want to give the user the flexibility of moving funds around, without the headache of making the
flows for it themselves.

For interoperability to work, there are two flows that a dApp can implement:

- Interoperability with Plugins (WalletConnect & Torus Wallet)
- Using Web3Auth Dashboard Toggles (No code way to enable interoperability with Torus Wallet)

## Interoperability with Plugins (WalletConnect & Torus Wallet)

---

Web3Auth supports UI plugins for Torus Wallet operations, helping you with flows to add funds, manage transactions and much more. This helps you avoid
making wallet flows within your application. Additionally, these plugins give you the advantage of using the same key from Web3Auth across multiple
applications using Torus Wallet and Wallet Connect.

You can natively within your application, use the Wallet Connect function after adding in the Torus Wallet plugin. This triggers the scan QR Code flow
of Wallet Connect to help you connect to the application.

:::info

Currently, the following plugins are supported:

- [Torus EVM Wallet UI Plugin](/sdk/web/plugins/torusevmwalletplugin)
- [Torus Solana Wallet UI Plugin](/sdk/web/plugins/torussolanawalletplugin)

Read more about them in the [Plugins SDK Reference](/sdk/web/plugins).

:::

#### Example

```js
import { TorusWalletConnectorPlugin } from "@web3auth/torus-wallet-connector-plugin";

const torusPlugin = new TorusWalletConnectorPlugin({
  torusWalletOpts: {},
  walletInitOptions: {
    whiteLabel: {
      theme: { isDark: true, colors: { primary: "#00a8ff" } },
      logoDark: "https://web3auth.io/images/w3a-L-Favicon-1.svg",
      logoLight: "https://web3auth.io/images/w3a-D-Favicon-1.svg",
    },
    useWalletConnect: true,
    enableLogging: true,
  },
});
await web3auth.addPlugin(torusPlugin);
```

## Using Web3Auth Dashboard Toggles

---

Within the Web3Auth Dashboard, while setting up a new Plug and Play project, or editing an existing one, you have the option to configure
interoperability with Torus Wallet. To enable it, you need to do the following steps:

- Create a new/ edit your existing Plug and Play project

  <img src={CreateImageUrl} style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "400px", margin: "20px auto" }} alt="" />

<div className="text-image-column">
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Select the chain you want your dApp to interact with. For interoperability, you have the option between <code>EVM based chains</code>,{" "}
        <code>Solana</code> &<code>Casper</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src={CreateDashboardPnp} style={{ minWidth: "200px", maxWidth: "250px" }} alt="" />
  </div>
</div>

- Once you have selected one of the chains supported by Torus Wallet, you can now select the option `Allow user's private key usage in given wallets:`
  to enable interoperable flow with the Torus Wallets. These wallets can be accessed on the following domains:

<div className="text-image-column">
  <div>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>EVM Wallet</b> - https://app.tor.us
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Solana Wallet</b> - https://solana.tor.us
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Casper Wallet</b> - https://casper.tor.us
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src={CreateDashboardPnp4} style={{ minWidth: "300px", maxWidth: "350px" }} alt="" />
  </div>
</div>
<br />

And you're done! Now, your user can use their Web3Auth private key from your application to sign transactions within Torus Wallet.

### Flow for the user in Torus Wallet

- Once you have enabled the interoperability flow, you user can navigate to the respective Torus Wallet app ([EVM](https://app.tor.us),
  [Solana](https://solana.tor.us) or [Casper](https://casper.tor.us)).
- To access their key inside Torus Wallet, your user needs to log into Torus Wallet using the same authentication method they used for your
  application.
  <img style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "400px", margin: "20px auto" }} alt="" src={Image1} />
- Once logged in, you user will be able to access the desired private key within while logging in and inside the Torus Wallet application.
  - In the screenshots below, the `Project Name` for application (demo-app.web3auth.io) using Web3Auth is `Ahash`.
