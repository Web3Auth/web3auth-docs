To get a Client ID, you'll need to create a new Plug and Play project from the Web3Auth Dashboard. Plug and Play refers to the customised UI that
Web3Auth provides to integrate with your project, enabling you to seamlessly integrate Web3Auth without the need of designing the whole flow.

The Dashboard will look something like this:

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Image3} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>
<br />

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "10px" }}>
  <div style={{ flexBasis: "30%", flexGrow: "10", justifyContent: "center" }}>
    Here, I've already created a project called <strong>"Test Project"</strong>.
    <br />
    <br />
    If you want to create a new project, just click on the Create Project tab on the right and you'll see a toggle similar to this, where you need to enter
    your Project Name, choose an environment and the chain you want to integrate with. There are multiple options for production environment based on your needs.

  </div>
  <div
    style={{
      flexBasis: "40%",
      flexGrow: "1",
      alignItems: "center",
      justifyContent: "center",
    }}
  >
    <img style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "500px", alignSelf: "center" }} src={Image4} />
  </div>
</div>

## Diving into a Web3Auth project

A project contains the following:

### Client ID

This is the unique identifier for your project. It is used to identify your project in the Web3Auth dashboard. You'll need this while initialising the
Web3Auth SDK, within your app. This gets automatically generated once you create a project. Make sure to copy this value into your initialisation
code.

### Client Secret

This is the secret key that is used to authenticate your project. This also gets automatically generated once you create a project.

### Add a new whitelist URL

This is the URL that you want to whitelist for your project. You'll need to whitelist the URLs from which you are making the calls for logging in your
users and for making transactions.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={DashboardImage} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>
