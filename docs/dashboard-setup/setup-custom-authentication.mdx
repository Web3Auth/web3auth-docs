The Custom Authentication section of the Web3Auth dashboard is where you can create a new verifier. This verifier allows you to implement custom
authentication within your application, providing additional security and flexibility for your users. By creating a Custom Authentication Verifier,
you can tailor your authentication process to the unique needs of your project and its users.

But before understanding about custom authentication, let us see **What is a Verifier?**

#### What is a Verifier?

A verifier is a piece of information about the OAuth provider being used by the application, which is queried by web3auth auth network nodes from a
smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to verify the JWT token.

There are two types of `Verifiers` at Web3Auth:

1. `Default Verifiers`: These are the verifiers associated with OAuth providers(Google, Facebook, Apple etc.) which are owned and managed by
   Web3Auth's account.
2. `Custom Verifiers`: If you want to manage your OAuth providers(Google, Facebook, Apple etc.) yourself or to use some Federated Identity Providers
   like Auth0, Firebase, AWS Cognito, Okta etc., or even your Custom JWT Authentication, you'll need to create a verifier under a project on the
   Web3Auth's dashboard.

For users to be able to log in using your custom authentication flow, you will need to use a Custom Verifier. The Wallet that is generated for each
user is specific to a verifier. Verifier scripts determine the access structure to your users' wallets, and the set of Verifier scripts you choose
will determine which logins your application will ultimately use.

You can read more about verifiers [in this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/Web3Auth/discussions/427#discussioncomment-3442052).

The `Custom Authentication` tab of a project looks something like this:

## Create Verifier

Once you click on the `Create Verifier` button, you'll see a toggle similar to this:

![Verifier Modal on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/dashboard/create-verifier.png)

To create a verifier, you need to input the following details:

### Verifier identifier

The identifier for your verifier. You'll need this while initializing the `Web3Auth`/`Web3AuthNoModal` SDK for setting up the custom authentication.

### Choose a Login Provider

Select the Login Provider from the provided options.

The following is the list we have on our Dashboard:

1. Social Login Providers
   - [Google](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/google)
   - [Facebook](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/facebook)
   - [Twitch](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/twitch)
   - [Discord](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/discord)
2. Custom Providers
   - [Auth0](/auth-provider-setup/federated-identity-providers#auth0)
   - [Custom JWT](/auth-provider-setup/byo-jwt-providers)
3. Aggregate Multiple Providers
   - [Aggregate Verifier](/auth-provider-setup/aggregate-verifier)

If something you're looking for is not available in the list, choose `Custom Provider` and provide the JWT details.
