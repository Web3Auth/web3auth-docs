This is a step by step guide to help you get started with using the Web3Auth dashboard.

## Getting Started

To get started, login with any of your social accounts on the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/). Please note that this is login
flow is using the Web3Auth login flow with a Customised UI. So essentially, we're creating a wallet for you. Your users will have a similar flow using
your application integrated with Web3Auth.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Image1} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>
<br />

## Home

Once you've successfully logged in, you will see screen that looks like this:

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Image2} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>
<br />

## Torus Wallet

---

This is the Torus Wallet section of the dashboard. It is where you can create a new Torus Wallet project. Torus Wallet refers to the wallet adapter
that can be used to integrate with the Web3Auth SDK. You can read more about Torus Wallet [here](https://docs.tor.us/wallet/get-started)

The Torus Wallet Dashboard looks something like this:

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Image8} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>
<br />

### Diving into a Torus Wallet project

A project contains the following:

#### Client ID

This is the unique identifier for your project. You'll need this while initialising the Torus Wallet Adapter within the Web3Auth SDK. This gets
automatically generated once you create a project. Make sure to copy this value into your initialisation code.

#### Client Secret

This is the secret key that is used to authenticate your project. This also gets automatically generated once you create a project.
