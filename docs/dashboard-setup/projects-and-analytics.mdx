Create a new project in the Web3Auth dashboard to obtain a Client ID. During this process, you will be prompted to select the Web3Auth product you
intend to use and the Platform, environment, and Chains that suit your needs.

Web3Auth offers a "Plug and Play" feature that provides a pre-built user interface and user experience for integrating with your project. This feature
makes it easy and efficient to integrate Web3Auth, eliminating the need to design the entire process from scratch.

The "Core Kit" refers to the underlying SDKs of the Plug and Play. This option offers the maximum level of customization.

The project page on the dashboard will appear similar to this:

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={DashboardProjectList} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Dashboard Project List" />
</div>

## Create a new project

### Name your project

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={CreateProjectName} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Create Project Name" />
</div>

### Select a web3auth product

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={CreateProjectProduct} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Create Project Select Product" />
</div>

### Select a platform type

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={CreateProjectPlatformType} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Create Project Platform Type" />
</div>

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={CreateProjectPlatformTypeFilled} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Create Project Platform Type Filled" />
</div>

### Select an environment

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={CreateProjectEnvironment} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Create Project Select Environment" />
</div>

### Select chains

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>

</div>

## Diving into a Web3Auth project

A project contains the following details:

### Client ID

The Project ID is a distinctive identifier for your project and is used to identify your project within the Web3Auth dashboard. You will need this ID
when initializing the Web3Auth SDK within your application. Once you create a project, the Project ID is automatically generated for you. It is
important to copy and include this value in your initialization code to ensure seamless integration with Web3Auth.

### Client Secret

The Project Secret Key is a confidential code utilized to verify your project's authenticity. Like the Project ID, the Secret Key is also generated
automatically upon project creation.

### Add a new whitelist URL

The Whitelist URL is the address you wish to authorize for your project. When implementing Web3Auth, it is important to whitelist the specific URLs
from which you intend to make calls for user authentication. By doing so, you can ensure that these activities are conducted securely and efficiently.
Remember to whitelist all relevant URLs to guarantee seamless integration with Web3Auth.

  <img src={DashboardWhiteListURL} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Dashboard Whitelist" />
</div>

### Archieve a project

You can archive a project by clicking the "Archive" button on the project page. This action will remove the project from the dashboard and prevent you
from using the Client ID to authenticate users. You can unarchive a project by clicking the "Unarchive" button from the archieve page .

## Project Analytics

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Analytics} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Project Analytics" />
</div>

Project analytics is a system that collects and examines data related to user engagement and usage. The system includes several key components, such
as the number of logins, the count of monthly active wallets, a monthly active wallets overview in the form of a pie chart, verifier details, and the
ability to view data for different time periods. These tools offer valuable insights into document management and user engagement strategies.
