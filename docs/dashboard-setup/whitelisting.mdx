### Whitelisting URLs using the Developer Dashboard

The Whitelist URL is the address you wish to authorize for your project. When implementing Web3Auth, it is important to whitelist the specific URLs
from which you intend to make calls for user authentication. By doing so, you can ensure that these activities are conducted securely and efficiently.
Remember to whitelist all relevant URLs to guarantee seamless integration with Web3Auth.

Type in the URL you wish to whitelist in the text box and click on the `Add URL` button. The URL will be added to the list of whitelisted URLs. You
can add as many URLs as you want.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={DashboardWhiteListURL} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Dashboard Whitelist URL" />
</div>

### Whitelisting for Mobile apps

You can use the Developer Dashboard to whitelist URLs for mobile apps as well. For Android, you can whitelist the URL by adding the `intent-filter`
making the links universal. For iOS, you can whitelist the URL by adding the `Associated Domains` in the `Capabilities` section of the project. For an
extensive guide on deep linking and app linking for Android apps, please refer to the following
[blog](/content-hub/blog/comprehensive-guide-to-deep-links-and-app-links-in-android).

### Manual Whitelisting for Advanced Cases

You can use the manual origin whitelisting method to whitelist URLs without using the Developer Dashboard. `OpenLoginAdapter` accepts a parameter
called `originData` inside the `adapterSettings`. `originData` is a key value pair where the key is the origin URL and the value is a `signature`. The
signature is generated by `whitelistUrl` function from the `@toruslabs/openlogin` package. The `whitelistUrl` function accepts the `clientId`,
`clientSecret` and `origin` as parameters.

:::warning Note

Please perform this in a highly secure environment. The `clientSecret` should not be exposed to the public making this a risky process.

:::

```tsx
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter";
import { whitelistUrl } from "@toruslabs/openlogin";
import { CommonPrivateKeyProvider } from "@web3auth/base-provider";

const clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"; // get from https://dashboard.web3auth.io
const clientSecret = "CORRESPONDING_CLIENT_SECRET"; // get from https://dashboard.web3auth.io
const origin = "https://example.com";

const privateKeyProvider = new CommonPrivateKeyProvider({ config: { chainConfig } });
const sig = await whitelistUrl(clientId, clientSecret, origin);

const openloginAdapter = new OpenloginAdapter({
  privateKeyProvider,
  adapterSettings: {
    originData: { [origin]: sig },
  },
});
```

### How to secure deep linking via whitelisting strategies to avoid phishing attacks?

Deep links are a type of link that can direct users deeper into a native mobile application. These are useful for connecting users to specific content
within apps, but they don't have built-in mechanisms for verifying the authenticity of the destination app. This can potentially expose users to
phishing attacks if they are directed to a malicious app instead.

On the other hand, Android's App Links and iOS's Universal Links (similar in purpose to App Links) are more secure versions of deep links. They
include a verification process that Android and iOS use to confirm the link's destination. In the case of App Links, Android checks the app's digital
asset links file hosted on the website's server, which contains information that links the website's URL to the app. This information must also be
included in the app's manifest file. This process ensures that the app associated with the website is the legitimate destination, thereby mitigating
the risk of phishing by not allowing malicious apps to intercept these links.

All OAuth applications work on whitelisting strategies. One may use App links or Universal links to secure the backlinking via whitelisting instead of
deep links.

#### Some security concerns should be addressed when it comes to deep linking:

- Deep links sometimes carry sensitive information, hence it's vital to avoid passing crucial information directly via the URLs.
- Opaque tokens with limited validity should be utilized to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
- Secure channels, such as `HTTPS` should be used to transmit deep links to prevent eavesdropping.
