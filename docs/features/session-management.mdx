Web3Auth SDKs offer a comprehensive session management feature designed to enhance the user
experience by minimizing the need for repeated logins. This feature ensures that once users
authenticate, their login state is maintained for a specified duration, allowing for seamless
interaction within the application.

## Benefits of Session Management

- **Enhanced User Experience:** By reducing the frequency of logins, session management provides a
  more fluid and user-friendly experience within the application.
- **Speed and Efficiency:** Session restoration is a rapid process, occurring in milliseconds, which
  ensures that users have immediate access to their authenticated state.
- **Seamless Integration:** The implementation of session management is designed to be
  straightforward, with minimal impact on the existing user flow and application design.

## Detailed Overview of Session Management

The essence of session management in Web3Auth revolves around securely maintaining a user's
authenticated state using a sophisticated encryption and storage mechanism. Here's a closer look at
how this process unfolds:

### Generating and Storing the Session Key

1. **Session Key Generation:** Upon successful user login, a unique session key is generated on the
   front-end. This key plays a crucial role in encrypting the user's login state, ensuring that it
   remains secure throughout its lifecycle.

2. **Encryption of User State:** The user's login state is encrypted using the session key. This
   encrypted state encapsulates all necessary information to maintain the user's session,
   safeguarding it against unauthorized access.

3. **Metadata Server Storage:** The encrypted user state is then transmitted and stored on the
   Web3Auth metadata server. The storage duration is determined by the `sessionTime` parameter,
   which developers can configure based on the application's requirements.

### Secure Session Key Storage

The session key is securely stored within the client's environment. For web applications, this
typically involves using the browser's local storage. Mobile applications, on the other hand,
leverage platform-specific secure storage solutions like Android Encrypted Shared Preferences and
iOS Keychain Services.

### Session Restoration Process

1. **Retrieving the Session Key:** When the SDK is initialized, it first attempts to retrieve the
   session key from the client's secure storage.

2. **Communicating with the Metadata Server:** With the session key, the SDK reaches out to the
   Web3Auth metadata server, requesting the restoration of the stored user state if an active
   session exists.

3. **Decrypting the User State:** If a valid session is identified, the encrypted user state is
   retrieved from the server and decrypted using the session key. This decrypted state is then used
   to automatically log the user back into the application.

4. **Fallback to Standard Login:** In cases where no active session is found (either because it has
   expired or does not exist), the user is directed to proceed with the standard login process.

## Customizing Session Duration

Developers have the flexibility to define the duration of the session through the `sessionTime`
parameter, setting it anywhere from 1 day to a maximum of 30 days. This allows for a balance between
convenience for the user and security considerations for the application. It is recommended to
initiate the Web3Auth SDKs at the start of your application (e.g., in the constructor) to ensure
that users benefit from an uninterrupted experience, with their login state ready and waiting as
they engage with your application.
