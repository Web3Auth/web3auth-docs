Pre-generated wallets are a strategic feature within Web3Auth, designed to streamline the onboarding
process by allowing developers to create wallet addresses for users before their initial login. This
feature offers flexibility in how and when you introduce users to wallet functionalities, enhancing
the user experience and engagement.

## Capabilities of Pre-generated Wallets

The ability to pre-generate wallets opens up a variety of use cases, making it easier to integrate
Web3 features into your application's user journey:

- **Early Wallet Creation:** Initiate wallet creation as part of the user invite or onboarding flow,
  even before the user has logged into your app for the first time.
- **Deferred Login Setup:** Delay the setup of wallet access management, such as OAuth login or
  passkeys, until the user is ready for their first on-chain transaction, simplifying initial
  engagement.
- **Wallet Prefunding:** Reward users with tokens for off-chain activities, allowing them to claim
  these rewards when they access their pre-generated wallet.

:::note Minimum Scale plan required

Access to Wallet Pregeneration is gated. You can use this feature in the development environment for
free. The minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this feature in a
production environment is the **Scale Plan**.

## Utilizing the Pre-generated Wallet API

Web3Auth provides a straightforward API to facilitate the creation of pre-generated wallets. You can
integrate this API into your user signup flow, either after a user verifies their email or
independently by supplying their email or unique identifier to the API.

:::warning

This API only returns the Core Kit Key wallet addresses. To use the wallet addresses with the
Web3Auth SDKs, you will need to either use the `useCoreKitKey` flag in our PnP SDKs or use any of
our Core Kit SFA SDKs

[keys can change within different Web3Auth Products](/docs/troubleshooting/different-private-key#product)

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Identify Users:** Determine the unique identifier or email for the user within your system.
   This will be the `verifierId` used to create the wallet.
2. **API Call:** Use the provided API to submit the user's identifier. You'll need to specify
   parameters from the Web3Auth dashboard, specifically the Verifier Name, Web3Auth Network, and
   Client Id.
3. **Receive Wallet Address:** The API response will include the new wallet address, ready for use
   by the user upon their first login.
