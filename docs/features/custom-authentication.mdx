# Custom Authentication with Web3Auth

Custom Authentication represents a pivotal feature within Web3Auth, enabling the integration of
bespoke authentication flows into your application. This approach is recommended for those seeking
to move beyond Web3Auth's standard authentication modal, offering a more tailored and comprehensive
user experience. It empowers developers to craft authentication flows that are not only unique to
their applications but also align with the nuanced needs of their user base.

:::note

Access to Custom Authentication is gated. The minimum
[pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to create custom
[verifiers](/auth-provider-setup/verifiers) is the **Growth Plan**. However, you can use this
feature for projects on `sapphire_devnet` for free.

Check out our reference on [Auth Provider Setup](/auth-provider-setup) for a detailed guide on how
to set up your custom authentication.

## Advantages of Custom Authentication

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Custom Authentication ensures a seamless journey for users from the
  start of the authentication process to its completion, maintaining consistency with your
  application's design and workflow.
- **Customizable User Data Collection:** It allows for the customization of the data collected from
  users during the authentication process, enabling you to tailor onboarding and user management
  according to your specific requirements.
- **Seamless User Migration:** For applications transitioning to Web3Auth, Custom Authentication
  facilitates the migration of existing user bases without necessitating the creation of new
  accounts, thereby preserving user continuity.

## Implementation Across Web3Auth Products

- **Plug and Play SDKs:** While Custom Authentication remains an optional feature for Plug and Play
  SDKs, it's highly recommended for developers looking to provide a unique user experience and meet
  specific authentication requirements.
- **Core Kit SDKs:** Custom Authentication is a fundamental requirement for Core Kit SDKs,
  underscoring the need for bespoke authentication flows that align with the specific needs of the
  application and its users.
- **Wallet Ecosystems:** Currently, Wallet Ecosystem integrations do not support Custom
  Authentication. These ecosystems leverage predefined authentication mechanisms specific to each
  wallet platform.

## FAQs

### Which logins should my application support?

You can select from [this list](/auth-provider-setup/#supported-auth-providers) or use your own
custom authentication. There are some nuances with certain login providers, so don't hesitate to get
in touch with us.

### Should different logins lead to the same key?

You can choose to connect logins with the same `Verifier ID`. For example, if a user uses generic
email logins and a Gmail login to log in on different occasions he/she can still retrieve the same
key. This can only be done on logins that share a common unique identifier for a user.

Read more about aggregating logins [here](/auth-provider-setup/aggregate-verifier).

### Can XXXX authenticator/login be supported?

Yes, If you'd like support for a particular login system do send your query over to
hello@web3auth.io If you have any questions, please get in touch with us on
