Custom Authentication enables you to create tailored auth flows designed specifically for your app.
Whether you’re migrating from an existing system or starting fresh, we’ve got you covered.

## Authentication Methods

### 1. Web3Auth's Built-in Social Logins

Web3Auth provides pre-built social login solutions that work out of the box. These use Web3Auth's
internal credentials and require minimal setup:

- Ready-to-use implementation
- Quick integration
- Managed by Web3Auth
- Limited customization options
- Best for rapid prototyping and simple applications

:::warning

If you opt for prebuilt social login providers, migration to custom authentication will not be
possible in the future.

:::

### 2. Custom Authentication (Recommended)

Custom Authentication offers more flexibility by allowing you to:

- Use your own credentials for social logins
- Integrate your existing authentication system
- Connect third-party identity providers (Auth0, Cognito, etc.)
- Maintain full control over the authentication flow
- Create custom user experiences
- Handle complex authentication requirements

:::note

Access to Custom Authentication is gated. The minimum
[pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to create custom
[verifiers](/auth-provider-setup/verifiers) is the **Growth Plan**. However, you can use this
feature for projects on `sapphire_devnet` for free.

:::

### 3. Grouped Custom Authentication

This method combines multiple authentication providers under a single
[aggregate verifier](/auth-provider-setup/aggregate-verifier), enabling:

- Same private key generation across different login methods
- User account linking across multiple providers
- Unified authentication experience
- Single user identity with multiple login options
- Seamless transition between authentication methods

:::tip

Check out our reference on [Auth Provider Setup](/auth-provider-setup) for a detailed guide on how
to set up your custom authentication.

## Why Choose Custom Authentication?

- **Effortless User Migration:** Transition existing users seamlessly while setting up wallets
  without requiring new accounts.

- **Native Experience:** Deliver an authentication flow that feels fully integrated with your app,
  avoiding redirects to Web3Auth screens.

- **Greater Control:** Own the authentication process, giving you flexibility to switch between SDKs
  and providers as needed.

## FAQs

### Which logins should my application support?

You can select from [this list](/auth-provider-setup/#supported-auth-providers) or use your own
custom authentication. There are some nuances with certain login providers, so don't hesitate to get
in touch with us.

### Should different logins lead to the same key?

You can choose to connect logins with the same `Verifier ID`. For example, if a user uses generic
email logins and a Gmail login to log in on different occasions he/she can still retrieve the same
key. This can only be done on logins that share a common unique identifier for a user.

Read more about aggregating logins [here](/auth-provider-setup/aggregate-verifier).

### Can XXXX authenticator/login be supported?

Yes, If you'd like support for a particular login system do send your query over to
