The Fiat On-Ramp Aggregator, a key component of Web3Auth's Wallet Services, significantly simplifies
the conversion process from fiat to cryptocurrency. With a straightforward one-line integration,
this service integrates over 100 payment methods, providing an efficient and user-friendly solution
for entering the crypto space.

## Features of the Fiat On-Ramp Aggregator

- **Diverse Payment Options:** Supports a broad spectrum of payment methods, catering to a global
  user base and ensuring accessibility for all.
- **Reduced Fees:** Offers up to 70% lower transaction fees compared to traditional methods, making
  cryptocurrency more accessible and economical.
- **Global Currency Support:** Ensures a seamless user experience with localized currency support,
  facilitating easier and more intuitive transactions worldwide.

## Overcoming Onramping Challenges

In key web3 markets such as India, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, traditional fiat-to-crypto
conversion methods, particularly through card rails like Visa and Mastercard, face high failure
rates of 30-70%. Such failures not only frustrate users but also lead to potential revenue losses.
The Fiat On-Ramp Aggregator addresses these challenges by incorporating prevalent local payment
methods, which represent over 60%-70% of transactions in these regions.

## Why Local Payment Methods?

- **Higher Monetization and Accessibility:** Local payment methods, being the most common in their
  respective countries, significantly enhance user monetization and accessibility due to their
  familiarity and real-time processing capabilities.
- **Lower Processing Fees:** Transactions processed through these methods incur lower fees than
  those processed via traditional card networks, making them a cost-effective alternative.
- **Improved Transaction Success Rates:** Unlike transactions on Visa and Mastercard networks, which
  often fail due to restrictions imposed by card-issuing banks, local payment methods do not face
  such limitations, resulting in higher success rates.
- **Enhanced Security:** Most local payment methods require 2-factor authentication (2FA) and are
  not subject to chargeback costs, offering a secure and cost-efficient solution for both users and
  merchants.

The Fiat On-Ramp Aggregator by Web3Auth Wallet Services represents a pivotal advancement in bridging
the gap between fiat currencies and the cryptocurrency market. By leveraging local payment methods
and reducing dependency on traditional card rails, Web3Auth ensures a smoother, more reliable, and
cost-effective entry point into the world of cryptocurrency, enhancing the overall user experience
and fostering global adoption.
