Web3Auth's architecture is designed to be inherently blockchain agnostic, providing seamless
integration across a diverse range of blockchain ecosystems. This flexibility is a core component of
Web3Auth's approach to decentralized authentication, ensuring broad applicability and
interoperability.

## Reference Guides for Blockchain Connections

You can check out the following guides we've written for certain blockchains. We have covered a wide
variety of EVM and EVM Chains, supported by multiple web3auth providers.

## Key Curve Support and Blockchain Compatibility

By default, Web3Auth supports the `secp256k1` and `ed25519` key curves, which are widely used across
the majority of blockchain platforms. This inclusion ensures compatibility with a vast array of
blockchain environments right out of the box.

### Extending Beyond Default Curves

While these curves cater to most blockchain requirements, Web3Auth recognizes the unique needs of
various blockchains, some of which utilize different curve implementations. To accommodate these
diverse ecosystems, Web3Auth's PnP & SFA (Shamir Secret Sharing based) enable interaction with any
blockchain, regardless of its specific curve requirements.

## Dedicated Providers for MPC Core Kit

For those utilizing Web3Auth's MPC Core Kit, dedicated providers are necessary to ensure optimal
interaction with specific blockchains. Currently, Web3Auth MPC Core Kit offers support for
EVM-compatible chains and Bitcoin, with development underway to include Solana. This approach
guarantees that Web3Auth remains at the forefront of blockchain authentication, offering versatile
and secure solutions for a wide array of blockchain technologies.

## Utilizing Private Keys with PnP & SFA

In the realm of PnP & SFA, Web3Auth offers the capability to export the user's private key. This
feature allows decentralized applications (dApps) to directly interact with the blockchain using the
exported key, facilitating a wide range of transactions and smart contract interactions.

Web3Auth's composability enhances its blockchain agnosticism. It seamlessly integrates with
meta-transaction flows, multisigs, and various cryptographic protocols, making it a versatile
foundation for building decentralized solutions. Web3Auth is compatible with numerous technology
stacks, including scalability solutions, smart contract wallets, different elliptic curve pairs, and
even RSA.
