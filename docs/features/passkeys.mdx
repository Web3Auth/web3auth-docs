Passkeys are an innovative feature that offers a convenient, secure, and passwordless authentication
method, enhancing the user experience while maintaining robust security. Leveraging the WebAuthn
standard, passkeys eliminate the need for traditional passwords, making the authentication process
seamless and user-friendly. Web3Auth supports passkeys through its Single Factor Auth (SFA) Web SDK,
providing a smooth integration for developers.

## Key Benefits of Passkeys

### Convenience

- **Passwordless Login:** Users can authenticate without the need for passwords, reducing friction
  and improving the overall user experience.
- **Biometric Authentication:** Passkeys support biometric methods such as fingerprint or facial
  recognition, offering a quick and secure way to log in.

### Security

- **Phishing Resistant:** Passkeys are inherently phishing-resistant, as they use public-key
  cryptography and are bound to the origin they were created for, making it difficult for attackers
  to intercept or misuse them.
- **Strong Authentication:** Passkeys provide a strong form of authentication, leveraging the
  security features of the user's device.

### Seamless Integration

- **Web3Auth SFA SDK Compatibility:** The Passkeys SFA Plugin integrates seamlessly with Web3Auth
  Single Factor Auth (SFA) Web SDK, enabling easy implementation of passkey registration, login, and
  management functionalities.

:::info Web3Auth SFA SDK Compatibility

For now, passkeys support is available for the Web3Auth Single Factor Auth (SFA) Web SDK through the
Passkeys SFA Plugin package. Support for additional SDKs is coming soon.
