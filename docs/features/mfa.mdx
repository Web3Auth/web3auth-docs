title: Multi Factor Authentication

description: "Multi Factor Authentication | Documentation - Web3Auth"

With Web3auth, you can enable you users to set users multi-factor authentication (MFA) for embedded
wallets. This feature enhances wallet security by tying access to additional authentication factors
such as social logins, devices, or recovery phrases. By requiring additional verification, MFA
ensures users can securely control and recover their wallets while maintaining a self-custodial
setup. The key recovery methods that we support out of the box are:

## One-Click Login (Single Factor Auth)

This is the simplest flow for a user to onboard with Web3Auth. The user just needs to click on the
login button, connect to their favorite social account (OAuth) or any passwordless flow, like
email-passwordless, biometric authentication etc., and a wallet is generated for them. This flow has
a 1/1 Key Share setup and the whole key via Web3Auth Auth Network key shares. This flow is still
non-custodial since the nodes in the Web3Auth network have a 5/9 consensus mechanism to generate the
key shares.

:::warning

While analyzing, one can claim that this flow is custodial to the OAuth Login provider, since this
is directly generated using credentials provided by them. Also, since the Web3Auth Network handles
this flow independently, even while being decentralized, **we can call this flow a semi-custodial
flow.**

:::

:::info technical insight

In our One Click Flow, we add a `nonce` value, stored in our encrypted metadata server, to the
social login share to keep the threshold 2/2, while it feels like 1/1. This is done to ensure that
the application has the flexibility to move to a 2/n MFA flow in the future if they want to. As the
application triggers the creation of MFA Factors the nonce is automatically deleted.

:::tip

- The [**Single Factor SDKs**](/sdk/sfa/sfa-js) help you directly achieve this flow.

- For Plug and Play SDKs, this flow can be achieved by setting the
  [`MFALevel` to `'none'`](/sdk/pnp/web/modal/initialize#multi-factor-authentication) within the
  Web3Auth Login while logging a user in.

## Adding Multi-Factor Authentication

The Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) feature refers to the ability of the user to create a backup
share (recovery factor). This feature plays a key role in the Wallet Infrastructure of Web3Auth and
a developer needs to properly understand it to be able to onboard users safely and effectively.

The most interesting feature of adding a multi-factor authentication is that it makes the keys
**self-custodial** to the user. This is achieved by associating a key share alongside the factor
that the user chooses to create, hence making sure the key is further distributed and not just
associated with the user's social account or the Web3Auth Network.

### Types of MFA Flows

With Core Kit MFA and Plug and Play SDKs, you have the choice to use multiple types of multi-factor
flows according to your needs. With Plug and Play, we expose various logins out of the box. For Core
Kit SDKs, the developers can determine which flow suits them the most, with total freedom of
managing key storage and access.
