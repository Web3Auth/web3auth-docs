Web3Auth's modular structure for its Plug and Play SDKs includes the capability for multiple
external wallet connections within the modal, facilitating seamless onboarding for both
crypto-native and non-crypto-native users. This feature underscores Web3Auth's dedication to
supporting all required authentication flows through a simple integration process.

## Key Features of Wallet Aggregation

Web3Auth's wallet aggregation is made possible through the use of adapters, which are essentially
connectors allowing for direct communication between Web3Auth and various external wallet providers,
such as MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase, and more.

:::note

This feature is currently available for Web SDKs only. Mobile and Gaming SDK adapters are in
development.

:::info Integrate the wallet of your choice

Currently, Web3Auth supports the following wallets, please go to their respective SDK References to
integrate them into your project:

- [Auth Adapter](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth)
- [Torus EVM Wallet](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/torus-evm)
- [Torus Solana Wallet](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/torus-solana)
- [WalletConnect V2](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/wallet-connect-v2)
- [Coinbase Wallet](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/coinbase)

## Understanding Adapters

Adapters are essentially connectors between Web3Auth and the underlying wallet provider. For
example, an adapter for connecting with the torus wallet is available under web3auth as
[@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/torus-evm). Every adapter follows a common
interface which is required by Web3Auth to communicate with the wallet.

An adapter emits certain events like `CONNECTED`, `CONNECTING`, and `DISCONNECTED` etc during the
login lifecycle of a user. Each adapter exposes the provider on successful user login that can be
used to invoke RPC calls on the wallet and connected blockchain.

### Currently Available Wallet Adapters

By default, Web3Auth's modal UI supports a set of default adapters depending on the `authMode` being
used. By default, Web3Auth requires basic configuration `client_id`, and registering a redirect if
you are using a CustomAuth adapter from the dashboard.

The table below summarizes all the available adapters and their properties

| Adapter            | ChainNamespace    | Default | Package Name                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `auth`             | `EIP155`,`SOLANA` | `YES`   | [`@web3auth/auth-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth)                   |
| `torus-evm`        | `EIP155`          | `NO`    | [`@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/torus-evm)         |
| `torus-solana`     | `SOLANA`          | `NO`    | [`@web3auth/torus-solana-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/torus-solana)   |
| `coinbase`         | `EIP155`          | `NO`    | [`@web3auth/coinbase`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/coinbase)                   |
| `walletconnect-v2` | `EIP155`          | `NO`    | [`@web3auth/wallet-connect-v2`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/wallet-connect-v2) |

## Extending Wallet Aggregation

In addition to Web3Auth's native adapters, developers can also leverage Web3Auth with other wallet
aggregation libraries such as `wagmi`. This integration enables the use of Web3Auth within popular
frameworks and products, enhancing the flexibility and reach of Web3Auth's authentication
capabilities.

### Integrating with Wagmi

Web3Auth's compatibility with wagmi, via the @web3auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector, allows for seamless
integration of Web3Auth's features within wagmi's comprehensive React Hooks for Ethereum. This
connector supports both modal and no-modal packages of Web3Auth, enabling integration within
products like Rainbow Kit, Connect Kit, and Web3Modal.

By embracing wallet aggregation with Web3Auth, developers can offer their users a versatile and
inclusive authentication experience, supporting a variety of wallets and enhancing the overall
usability of Web3 applications.
