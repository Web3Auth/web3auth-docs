# Web3Auth Self Host SDKs

---

If you want to self-host Web3Auth, you have the option to try out our UI-less SDK, `tKey`, which is the underlying SDK used to implement Web3Auth Plug
n Play. `tKey` stands for Threshold Key, which refers to the management keys & shares generated using threshold cryptography.

## The `tKey` SDK

The `tKey` SDK manages private keys by generating shares of it using Shamir Secret Sharing. For example, for a 2 out of 3 (2/3) setup, we give the
user three shares: ShareA, ShareB, and ShareC.

- **ShareA** is stored on the userâ€™s device: Implementation is device and system specific. For example, on mobile devices, the share could be stored
  in device storage secured via biometrics.
- **ShareB** is managed and split across Web3Auth's Auth Network, accessed by an OAuth login provider that a user owns.
- **ShareC** is a recovery share: An extra share to be kept by the user, possibly kept on a separate device, downloaded or based on user input with
  enough entropy (eg. password, security questions, hardware device etc.).

Similar to existing 2FA systems, a user needs to prove ownership of at least 2 out of 3 (2/3) shares, in order to retrieve his private key.

:::tip

This setup can be further customised using the `tKey` SDK according to your own needs, for example 3/n flows or starting out with 2/2. To know more
about how our infrastructure works, checkout our [Key Management Documentation](/overview/key-management)

:::caution

Applications/wallets must take care to ensure that `tKey` is implemented solely on the client-side for it to be non-custodial for users.
Implementation time is longer with `tKey`, if you need a faster and easier integration use the [Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs](/sdk/web/).
