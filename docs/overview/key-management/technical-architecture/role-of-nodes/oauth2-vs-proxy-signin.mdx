Proxy verifiers differ from a [standard verifier or 3rd party OAuth2 logins](logins-key-assignments-and-retrievals) as they depend on a proxy
inbetween the Torus Network and the third party \(Google\).

This is often a login service provider such as Auth0, AWS Cognito, or Okta, and the login flow differentiates as below:

This causes these logins to have an additional trust assumption with the proxy as well, on top of the original flow. For integrations involving a
proxy, we highly recommend DApps to inform users a third**-**party authenticator is present by including the line “_Note: The following sign-in
involves a third party authenticator: \(list the logins\) Linkedin, Twitter_. etc”.
