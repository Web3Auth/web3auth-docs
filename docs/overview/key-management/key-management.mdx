In this documentation we further describe the architecture of Web3Auth and detail several core user flows for onboarding, key recovery, and device
management.

## Base Web3Auth Key Infrastructure guarantees

With Web3Auth, users handle keys similar to a multi-factor account, where they use their OAuth login, devices and other factors to manage their key
pairs. In this example the user starts by generating a 2 out of 3 (2/3) Shamir Secret Sharing. This gives the user three shares: ShareA, ShareB, and
ShareC.

1. **ShareA is stored on the user's device**: Implementation is device and system specific. For example, on mobile devices, the share could be stored
   in device storage secured via biometrics.
2. **ShareB is managed by a login service via node operators**: This share is further split amongst a network of nodes and retrieved via conventional
   authentication flows.
3. **ShareC is a recovery share**: An extra share to be kept by the user, possibly kept on a separate device, downloaded or based on user input with
   enough entropy (eg. password, security questions, hardware device etc.).

Similar to existing 2FA systems, a user needs to prove ownership of at least 2 out of 3 (2/3) shares, in order to retrieve his private key. This
initial setup provides several benefits.

### Non-custodial

Using Web3Auth, the user is always in control of ownership and access to their cryptographic key pair. Login services only ever have access to one
share, and thus it's not possible for the provider to retrieve the user's private key on their own.

### Feels like Web 2.0 login flows

On a day-to-day basis Web3Auth allows access to a users key pair through flows indistinguishable from Web2.0 logins, contributing to greatly improving
user experience and onboarding

### Improvements to key recovery and redundancy

In the event of a lost device/share, there is redundancy built into the share threshold such that a user can still recover their key. It is also
possible to refresh shares such that lost shares are revoked.

This is an improvement over writing down a seed phrase on a piece of paper, since losing the seed phrase gives complete access to the private key.
Losing a share, however, is acceptable as long as the user does not lose more than one share without refreshing his existing shares.

### Incremental security

Users can increase security on their key by increasing the 2/3 threshold to a higher threshold. For example, a user can increase the threshold from
2/3 to 3/4 and add yet another authentication factor like a hardware device. This might be necessary if the user's has high amounts of cryptocurrency
on his private key.

### Chain/platform agnostic via native signatures

Web3Auth's resulting interface is a native cryptographic key pair, making it compatible with almost all cryptographic constructs on various platforms
and elliptic curves. Secret sharing and share refresh is also done completely off-chain, which makes Web3Auth usable on blockchains with limited smart
contract functionality.

### Censorship resistant

Using a 2/3 threshold also prevents censorship by the Torus nodes. In the case that the nodes refuse to return the share of the user's private key
even after the user has authenticated successfully, the user can still reconstruct their private key using ShareA (device share) and ShareC (recovery
share).

## Powered by the Auth Network

---

Web3Auth's social logins are powered by [the Auth Network](https://tor.us), an open-source, MPC key management network that splits and secures user
keys. Check out more about the tech [here](https://tor.us)

Members of the Torus Network are validator nodes that operate the Distributed Key Generation, Proactive Secret Sharing and Key Assignment protocol,
and consist of geographically distributed and diverse businesses institutions. The Torus Network exists to make their collective mission a reality: to
create a simple key management store that empowers billions of people to leverage on the benefits of blockchain technology. Each Torus Node is
represented on the Torus Network and governs its future.
