It is important to note that Web3Auth is not a wallet, it is wallet infrastructure that is plugged into applications or wallets. Web3Auth results in a
standard cryptographic key provider specific to the user and application. While using Web3Auth, you have the flexibility of creating your own wallet
within your application or using one of our pre existing adapters, which can handle the complexity of linking your application to a wallet.

## Using Web3Auth to build your Wallet

---

With Web3Auth, you have the flexibility of building an app with a wallet internally or a wallet itself.

This has the following advantages:

1. The dApp / wallet owns the whole experience, with minimal external branding. You're even able to use your own OAuth 2.0 / Single Sign-On.
2. First-time users don't need the mental overhead of understanding the concept of a "wallet" to use your application.
3. You can have users interact with their wallet and make transactions within your application, making the whole experience more seamless and specific
   to your app.

Although being the best experience for your users, building your own wallet comes with some hurdles. Generally, linking it to other dApps/apps is a
bit harder. To help you along the way, we have some solutions (such as natively integrated `wallet-connect` or the `torus-ui-plugin`), however, in
general, interoperability is harder. But we're making it easier one step at a time.

:::info Consider using the Torus Wallet

If you're looking for a wallet, checkout the [Torus Wallet](https://docs.tor.us/), compatible with any EVM chain and Solana

## Using Web3Auth with other Wallets via Adapters

---

In the Web SDK, we have adapters, which are essentially connectors between Web3Auth and the underlying wallet provider. For example, an adapter for
connecting with torus wallet is available under web3auth as `@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter`. Each adapter exposes provider on a successful user login
which can be used to invoke the RPC calls on wallet and connected blockchain.

Additionally, you can get Web3Auth to securely expose the private key of the user to your application's frontend. Using the private key, you can use
the wallet of your choice to make the further transactions within your application.
