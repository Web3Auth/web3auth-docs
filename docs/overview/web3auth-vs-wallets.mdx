It is important to note that **Web3Auth is not a wallet, it is wallet infrastructure that is plugged into applications or wallets.** Web3Auth results
in a standard cryptographic key provider specific to the user and application. While using Web3Auth, you have the flexibility of creating your own
wallet within your application or using one of our pre existing adapters, which can handle the complexity of linking your application to a wallet.

## Using Web3Auth to build your Wallet

---

With Web3Auth, you have the flexibility of actually building an app with a wallet internally or a wallet itself. This has advantages:

1. The dApp/ wallet owns the whole experience, with minimal external branding. You're even able to use your own OAuth/ Single Sign On.
2. First time users don't need the mental overhead of understanding the concept of a "wallet" to use your application.
3. You can have users interact with thier wallet and make transactions within your application, making the whole experience more seamless and specific
   to your app

Although being the best experience for your users, building your own wallet comes with some hurdles. Generally, linking it to other dapps/apps is a
bit harder. To help you along the way, we have some solutions (such as natively integrated `wallet-connect` or the `torus-ui-plugin`), however, in
general, interoperability is harder.

:::info Consider using the Torus Wallet

If you're looking for a wallet, checkout the [Torus Wallet](https://docs.tor.us/), compatible with any EVM chain and Solana

## Using Web3Auth with other Wallets via Adapters

---

In the Web SDK, we have adapters, which are essentially connectors between Web3Auth and the underlying wallet provider. For example, an adapter for
connecting with torus wallet is available under web3auth as @web3auth/torus-evm-adapter. Each adapter exposes provider on successful user login which
can be used to invoke RPC calls on wallet and on connected blockchain.

Additionally, you can get Web3Auth to securely expose the private key of the user to your application frontend. Using the private key, you can use the
wallet of your choice to make the further transactions within your application.
