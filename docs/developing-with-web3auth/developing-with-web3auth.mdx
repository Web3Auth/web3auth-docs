title: Web3Auth Development Terminologies
---

While going through the documentation and API reference, we will be using the following terminology throughout:

### Adapters

Adapters act as connectors between Web3Auth and the underlying wallet provider. For example, an adapter for connecting with torus wallet is available
under web3auth as [@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter](https://npm.io/package/@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter). Every adapter follows a common interface which is
required by Web3Auth to communicate with the wallet.

You can know more about Adapters [here](./adapters).

### Custom Authentication

Custom Authentication is a way to authenticate users with your own custom authentication service. For example, you can use a custom authentication
service like Firebase or Auth0 for providing the Web2 authentication aspect which can be passed on to Web3Auth via Verifiers and Web3Auth will proceed
with the process from there.

You can know more about Custom Authentication flow [here](./customauth).

#### Verifiers

A verifier is a unique identifier for your OAuth registration on the torus network. The Public/private keys generated for a user are scoped to a
verifier. The Custom Authentication flow deploys a Verifier Script determining the access structure to your users keys and which logins your
application will ultimately use. You can use your own login providers, using one of the custom login schemes (either via RSA or ECDSA signatures). The
application should follow the JWT specification and use JWKS for signing whose public keys are exposed by an endpoint.

Understand verifiers more in depth [here](./customauth/verifiers).

#### OAuth Access/ JWT Tokens

An OAuth Access Token is a string that the OAuth client uses to make requests to the resource server. JWT or
[JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/learn/json-web-tokens/) is a token format which defines a compact and self-contained mechanism for transmitting
data between parties in a way that can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs are used as OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens to encode all
relevant parts of an access token into the access token itself instead of having to store them in a database.

### Custom Login UI

Custom Login UI refers to the SDKs which provide the facility of using your own frontend login triggers/ UI elements within your application and use
the Web3Auth technology as a trigger to authenticate the users. Please note that this is different from Whitelabeling since the further login
processes will follow the same Web3Auth UI Elements.

Know more about which SDKs support what [here](./understand-sdk).

### Whitelabel

Whitelabeling enables you to customise the whole Web3Auth SDK elements according to your application needs. For example, you can choose to use your
own Plug and Play UI, logging screen animations, Custom Login UI etc. and have a consistent user experience throughout.

Know more about whitelabeling your application [here](./whitelabeling)

### Providers

A provider is how libraries like web3 & ethers.js talk to the blockchain. Providers take JSON-RPC requests and return the response. This is normally
done by submitting the request to an HTTP or IPC socket based server. Each adapter in web3auth exposes a provider on successful user authentication.
This provider can be use to interact with wallet or connected chain using rpc calls.
