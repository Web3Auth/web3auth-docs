This is a step by step guide to help you get started with using the Web3Auth dashboard.

## Getting Started

To get started, login with any of your social accounts on the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/). Please note that this is login
flow is using the Web3Auth login flow with a Customised UI. So essentially, we're creating a wallet for you. Your users will have a similar flow using
your application integrated with Web3Auth.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src="/dashboard/login.png" style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>
<br />

## Home

---

Once you've successfully logged in, you will see screen that looks like this:

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src="/dashboard/home.png" style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>
<br />

## Plug and Play

---

This is the Plug and Play section of the dashboard. It is where you can create a new Plug and Play project. Plug and Play refers to the customised UI
that Web3Auth provides to integrate with your project, enabling you to seemless integrate Web3Auth without the need of designing the whole flow.

The Dashboard will look something like this:

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src="/dashboard/plus_n_play.png" style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>
<br />

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "10px" }}>
  <div style={{ flexBasis: "30%", flexGrow: "10", justifyContent: "center" }}>
    Here, I've already created a project called <strong>"Test Project"</strong>.
    <br />
    <br />
    If you want to create a new project, just click on the Create Project tab on the right and you'll see a toggle similar to this, where you need to enter
    your Project Name, and it's done!
  </div>
  <div style={{ flexBasis: "40%", flexGrow: "1", alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center" }}>
    <img style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "500px", alignSelf: "center" }} src="/dashboard/create_project.png" />
  </div>
</div>

### Diving into a Web3Auth project

A project contains the following:

#### Client ID

This is the unique identifier for your project. It is used to identify your project in the Web3Auth dashboard. You'll need this while initialising the
Web3Auth SDK, within your app. This gets automatically generated once you create a project. Make sure to copy this value into your initialisation
code.

#### Client Secret

This is the secret key that is used to authenticate your project. This also gets automatically generated once you create a project.

#### Add a new whitelist URL

This is the URL that you want to whitelist for your project. You'll need to whitelist the URLs from which you are making the calls for logging in your
users and for making transactions.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src="/dashboard/project_plug_n_play.png" style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>

## Custom Authentication

---

This is the Custom Authentication section of the dashboard. It is where you can create a new Custom Authentication verifier.

Custom Authentication refers to the capability of hooking up your own custom authentication flow with Web3Auth. This gives you the flexibility of
using any authentication/ verification flow you want, providing us the verification token and the user details, and let Web3Auth do the rest.

The Custom Authentication Dashboard looks something like this:

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src="/dashboard/custom_auth.png" style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>
<br />

To get started, you need to create a verifier to let user login with your custom authentication flow. Verifier scripts determine the access structure
to your users keys and the set Verifier Scripts chosen determine which logins your application will ultimately use. You can read more about verifiers
[here](../developing-with-web3auth/verifiers.mdx)

### Creating a Verifier

Once you click on the Create Verifier tab, you'll see a toggle similar to this:

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src="/dashboard/verifier.png" style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>
<br />
To create a verifier, you need to input the following details:

#### Verifier identifier

The identifier for your verifier. This is used to identify your verifier in the Web3Auth dashboard. You'll need this while initialising the
Web3AuthCore SDK for setting up custom login.

#### Select Network

Select between testnet and mainnet. Make sure to always test your identifier in the testnet first before deploying it to the mainnet, to avoid
unnecessary fees.

#### Verifier Type

Select the type of verifier you want to create. We've pre provided a few common flows you can choose from, but you can also choose `Custom` and
provide all the JWT details.

## Torus Wallet

---

This is the Torus Wallet section of the dashboard. It is where you can create a new Torus Wallet project. Torus Wallet refers to the wallet adapter
that can be used to integrate with the Web3Auth SDK. You can read more about Torus Wallet [here](https://docs.tor.us/wallet/get-started)

The Torus Wallet Dashboard looks something like this:

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src="/dashboard/torus_wallet.png" style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>
<br />

### Diving into a Torus Wallet project

A project contains the following:

#### Client ID

This is the unique identifier for your project. You'll need this while initialising the Torus Wallet Adapter within the Web3Auth SDK. This gets
automatically generated once you create a project. Make sure to copy this value into your initialisation code.

#### Client Secret

This is the secret key that is used to authenticate your project. This also gets automatically generated once you create a project.

## Billing

---

This is the Billing section of the dashboard. It is where you can view your billing details. Here, you can track your **Monthly Active Users (MAUs)**,
which is the unit on which you're charged a usage fees from Web3Auth. You can see our billing tiers and pricing
[here](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html).

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
