Web3Auth comes with simple SDKs that can be integrated in multiple ways to provide the best experience for your users. Based on the platform of your
dApp or Wallet, we have the following SDKs:

## Web (JavaScript)

---

If you're just starting up and want to experience how it will look like within your application, we recommend you to use our **Plug n Play SDK
[`@web3auth/web3auth`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/web3auth)** which is a simple and easy to use SDK that will give you a simple modular way
of implementing Web3Auth directly within your application.

For more customised usage, we have our **Custom Login UI Module [`@web3auth/core`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/core)**, which is the core
module implemeting the features you need and giving you the flexibilty of using your own UI with the Web3Auth SDK working in the backend.

Additionally, for the Web, we have **adapters** and **providers** available to make the integration even more flexible. These packages are yet not
available for other platforms.

### Plug n Play SDK

### [`@web3auth/web3auth`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/web3auth)

This package provides main class for using default web3auth modal. It is a child class of `@web3auth/core` package. So you can still call all the
functions available in the `@web3auth/core` api reference. The package includes all of our packages and gives you a simple way of implementing
Web3Auth within your interface.

Head on to the [Plug n Play API Reference](/api-reference/web/plugnplay) to get started.

### Custom Login UI SDK

### [`@web3auth/core`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/core)

This package provides the core logic for handling adapters within web3auth. This package acts as a manager for all the adapters. You should use this
package to build your custom login UI on top of web3auth.

Head on to the [Custom Login UI API Reference](/api-reference/web/customloginui) to get started.

### Adapter packages

Adapter acts as a connector between the Web3Auth and underlying wallet provider. Every adapter follows a common interface which is required by
Web3Auth to communicate with the wallet.

To understand what they are and what they're for: Check out [Adapters](./adapters)

Currently we have the following adapters available for utilisation:

- [`@web3auth/openlogin-adapter`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/openlogin-adapter)
- [`@web3auth/phantom-adapter`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/phantom-adapter)
- [`@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter)
- [`@web3auth/torus-solana-adapter`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/torus-solana-adapter)
- [`@web3auth/metamask-adapter`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/metamask-adapter)
- [`@web3auth/wallet-connect-v1-adapter`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/wallet-connect-v1-adapter)

### Provider packages

Each adapter in web3auth exposes a provider on successful user authentication. This provider can be used to interact with wallet or connected chain
using rpc calls. Currently web3auth supports providers for both EVM and Solana chains. For other chains, one can easily get the private key from the
web3auth SDK. You can learn more about providers [here](./connect-blockchain).

- [`@web3auth/ethereum-adapter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/ethereum-provider)
- [`@web3auth/solana-adapter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/solana-provider)

## Android (Kotlin)

### [`web3auth-android-sdk`](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-android-sdk)

---

`web3auth-android-sdk` is a client-side library you can use with your Android app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. It helps you use a
[Plug and Play Project](/get-started/using-dashboard#plug-and-play) from the Web3Auth Dashboard and helps your sign in natively using your Android
device.

Additionally, you can use `loginProviders` method to add your own custom authentication verifiers to integrate with your existing authentication.

:::info note

Since the Android SDK doesn't have provider packages, it exposes the private key to the client side application of Android, using which you can easily
invoke RPC calls on wallet and on connected blockchain.

:::

## iOS (Swift)

### [`web3auth-swift-sdk`](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-swift-sdk)

---

`web3auth-android-sdk` is a client-side package you can use with your iOS app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. It helps you use a
[Plug and Play Project](/get-started/using-dashboard#plug-and-play) from the Web3Auth Dashboard and helps your sign in natively using your iOS device.

Additionally, you can use `loginProviders` method to add your own custom authentication verifiers to integrate with your existing authentication.

:::info note

Since the iOS SDK doesn't have provider packages, it exposes the private key to the client side application of iOS, using which you can easily invoke
RPC calls on wallet and on connected blockchain.

## React Native (JavaScript)

---

### Web3Auth React Native SDK

### [`web3auth-react-native-sdk`](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk)

We have our React Native SDK for Web3Auth, which essentially helps you use a [Plug and Play Project](/get-started/using-dashboard#plug-and-play) from
the Web3Auth Dashboard and helps your sign in natively using your Android or iOS device.

:::info note

Since the React Native SDKs don't have provider packages, they expose the private key to the client side application of iOS and Android respectively,
using which you can easily invoke RPC calls on wallet and on connected blockchain.

:::

## Flutter (Dart)

### [`web3auth-flutter-sdk`](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-flutter-sdk)

---

We have our Flutter SDK for Web3Auth, which essentially helps you use a [Plug and Play Project](/get-started/using-dashboard#plug-and-play) from the
Web3Auth Dashboard and helps your sign in natively using your Android or iOS device.

:::info note

Since the Flutter SDKs don't have provider packages, they expose the private key to the client side application of iOS and Android respectively, using
which you can easily invoke RPC calls on wallet and on connected blockchain.
