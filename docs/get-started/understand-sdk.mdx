Web3Auth comes with simple SDKs that can be integrated in multiple ways to provide the best experience for your users. Based on the platform of your
dApp or Wallet, we have the following SDKs:

## Web (JavaScript)

---

If you're just starting up and want to experience how it will look like within your application, we recommend you to use our **Plug n Play SDK
[`@web3auth/web3auth`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/web3auth)** which is a simple and easy to use SDK that will give you a simple modular way
of implementing Web3Auth directly within your application.

For more customised usage, we have our **Custom Login UI Module [`@web3auth/core`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/core)**, which is the core
module implemeting the features you need and giving you the flexibilty of using your own UI with the Web3Auth SDK working in the backend.

:::info

Additionally, for the Web, we have **adapters** and **providers** available to make the integration even more flexible. These packages are yet not
available for other platforms.

:::

### Plug n Play SDK

### [`@web3auth/web3auth`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/web3auth)

This package provides main class for using default web3auth modal. It is a child class of `@web3auth/core` package. So you can still call all the
functions available in the `@web3auth/core` api reference. The package includes all of our packages and gives you a simple way of implementing
Web3Auth within your interface.

Head on to the [Plug n Play API Reference](/api-reference/web/plugnplay) to get started.

### Custom Login UI SDK

### [`@web3auth/core`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/core)

This package provides the core logic for handling adapters within web3auth. This package acts as a manager for all the adapters. You should use this
package to build your custom login UI on top of web3auth.

Head on to the [Custom Login UI API Reference](/api-reference/web/customloginui) to get started.

### Adapter packages

Adapter acts as a connector between the Web3Auth and underlying wallet provider. Every adapter follows a common interface which is required by
Web3Auth to communicate with the wallet.

To understand what they are and what they're for: Check out [Adapters](./adapters)

Currently we have the following adapters available for utilisation:

- [`@web3auth/openlogin-adapter`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/openlogin-adapter)
- [`@web3auth/phantom-adapter`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/phantom-adapter)
- [`@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter)
- [`@web3auth/torus-solana-adapter`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/torus-solana-adapter)
- [`@web3auth/metamask-adapter`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/metamask-adapter)
- [`@web3auth/wallet-connect-v1-adapter`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/wallet-connect-v1-adapter)

### Provider packages

Each adapter in web3auth exposes a provider on successful user authentication. This provider can be used to interact with wallet or connected chain
using rpc calls. Currently web3auth supports providers for both EVM and Solana chains. For other chains, one can easily get the private key from the
web3auth SDK. You can learn more about providers [here](./connect-blockchain).

- [`@web3auth/ethereum-adapter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/ethereum-provider)
- [`@web3auth/solana-adapter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/solana-provider)

## Android (Kotlin)

### [`web3auth-android-sdk`](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-android-sdk)

---

`web3auth-android-sdk` is a client-side library you can use with your Android app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. It helps you use a
[Plug and Play Project](/get-started/using-dashboard#plug-and-play) from the Web3Auth Dashboard and helps your sign in natively using your Android
device.

Additionally, you can use `loginProviders` method to add your own custom authentication verifiers to integrate with your existing authentication.

:::info note

Since the Android SDK doesn't have provider packages, it exposes the private key to the client side application of Android, using which you can easily
invoke RPC calls on wallet and on connected blockchain.

:::

## iOS (Swift)

### [`web3auth-swift-sdk`](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-swift-sdk)

---

`web3auth-android-sdk` is a client-side package you can use with your iOS app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. It helps you use a
[Plug and Play Project](/get-started/using-dashboard#plug-and-play) from the Web3Auth Dashboard and helps your sign in natively using your iOS device.

Additionally, you can use `loginProviders` method to add your own custom authentication verifiers to integrate with your existing authentication.

:::info note

Since the iOS SDK doesn't have provider packages, it exposes the private key to the client side application of iOS, using which you can easily invoke
RPC calls on wallet and on connected blockchain.

## React Native (JavaScript)

---

### Web3Auth React Native SDK

### [`web3auth-react-native-sdk`](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk)

We have our React Native SDK for Web3Auth, which essentially helps you use a [Plug and Play Project](/get-started/using-dashboard#plug-and-play) from
the Web3Auth Dashboard and helps your sign in natively using your Android or iOS device.

:::info note

Since the React Native SDKs don't have provider packages, they expose the private key to the client side application of iOS and Android respectively,
using which you can easily invoke RPC calls on wallet and on connected blockchain.

:::

## Flutter (Dart)

### [`web3auth-flutter-sdk`](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-flutter-sdk)

---

We have our Flutter SDK for Web3Auth, which essentially helps you use a [Plug and Play Project](/get-started/using-dashboard#plug-and-play) from the
Web3Auth Dashboard and helps your sign in natively using your Android or iOS device.

:::info note

Since the Flutter SDKs don't have provider packages, they expose the private key to the client side application of iOS and Android respectively, using
which you can easily invoke RPC calls on wallet and on connected blockchain.

While going through the documentation and API reference, we will be using the following terminology throughout:

### Adapters

Adapters act as connectors between Web3Auth and the underlying wallet provider. For example, an adapter for connecting with torus wallet is available
under web3auth as [@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter). Every adapter follows a common interface which
is required by Web3Auth to communicate with the wallet.

You can know more about Adapters [here](./adapters).

### Custom Authentication

Custom Authentication is a way to authenticate users with your own custom authentication service. For example, you can use a custom authentication
service like Firebase or Auth0 for providing the Web2 authentication aspect which can be passed on to Web3Auth via Verifiers and Web3Auth will proceed
with the process from there.

You can know more about Custom Authentication flow [here](./customauth).

#### Verifiers

A verifier is a unique identifier for your OAuth registration on the torus network. The Public/private keys generated for a user are scoped to a
verifier. The Custom Authentication flow deploys a Verifier Script determining the access structure to your users keys and which logins your
application will ultimately use. You can use your own login providers, using one of the custom login schemes (either via RSA or ECDSA signatures). The
application should follow the JWT specification and use JWKS for signing whose public keys are exposed by an endpoint.

Understand verifiers more in depth [here](./customauth/verifiers).

#### OAuth Access/ JWT Tokens

An OAuth Access Token is a string that the OAuth client uses to make requests to the resource server. JWT or
[JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/learn/json-web-tokens/) is a token format which defines a compact and self-contained mechanism for transmitting
data between parties in a way that can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs are used as OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens to encode all
relevant parts of an access token into the access token itself instead of having to store them in a database.

### Custom Login UI

Custom Login UI refers to the SDKs which provide the facility of using your own frontend login triggers/ UI elements within your application and use
the Web3Auth technology as a trigger to authenticate the users. Please note that this is different from Whitelabeling since the further login
processes will follow the same Web3Auth UI Elements.

Know more about which SDKs support what [here](./understand-sdk).

### Whitelabel

Whitelabeling enables you to customise the whole Web3Auth SDK elements according to your application needs. For example, you can choose to use your
own Plug and Play UI, logging screen animations, Custom Login UI etc. and have a consistent user experience throughout.

Know more about whitelabeling your application [here](../whitelabeling)

### Providers

A provider is how libraries like web3 & ethers.js talk to the blockchain. Providers take JSON-RPC requests and return the response. This is normally
done by submitting the request to an HTTP or IPC socket based server. Each adapter in web3auth exposes a provider on successful user authentication.
This provider can be use to interact with wallet or connected chain using rpc calls.

Know more about providers [here](./connect-blockchain)
