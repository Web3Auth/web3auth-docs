Social providers allow you to register your app directly with [implicit grant support ](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/)and use them with
the Web3Auth SDK.

For social providers, you'll also need to set up an application with the integrating social login provider to get the Client ID / App ID which will be
used in the Custom Authentication.
