title: Verifiers
---

---

A verifier is a unique identifier for your OAuth registration on the torus network. The Public/Private keys generated for a user are scoped to a
verifier. The Custom Authentication flow deploys a Verifier Script determining the access structure to your users keys and which logins your
application will ultimately use.

## Supported Logins

---

Known logins or attestation methods that can be chosen include OAuths and custom logins methods:

| Attestation/Login Method | Lookups | Verifier ID Case-sensitive |
| :----------------------- | :------ | :------------------------- |
| Google OAuth2            | Y       | N                          |
| Reddit OAuth2            | Y       | N                          |
| Discord OAuth2           | Y       | Y                          |
| Twitch OAuth2            | N       | Y                          |
| Facebook OAuth2          | N       | Y                          |
| Apple (Proxy)            | N       | Y                          |
| Github (Proxy)           | Y       | N                          |
| Linkedin (Proxy)         | N       | Y                          |
| Weibo (Proxy)            | Y       | N                          |
| Twitter (Proxy)          | Y       | N                          |
| Line (Proxy)             | N       | Y                          |
| Auth0 login              | Depends | Depends                    |
| AWS Cognito              | Depends | Depends                    |
| Firebase                 | Depends | Depends                    |
| Custom JWT logins        | Depends | Depends                    |
| Custom ECDSA logins      | Depends | Depends                    |

## Aggregating Logins/Verifiers

---

It is possible to combine these attestation methods in AND/OR ways. For example you could combine a Google AND Discord login to access a key. this
vice versa can be done for Google OR Discord. For these aggregate verifiers, its important to note that a user's `Verifier ID` must be known ahead of
time, as keys in Torus are append only. Meaning to assign to a key to a user with the aggregate verifier Google OR Discord, we must know the users
gmail account and twitch account ahead of time.

This disadvantage can be subverted if the two attestation methods share the same `Verifier ID`. For example, Auth0 generic email logins OR Google
logins both use email accounts as the `Verifier ID`, as such the Verifier ID can me shared amonst the two. This is referred to as a Single ID
Verifier.

## Using your own custom login provider

---

You can use your own login providers, using one of the custom login schemes (either via JWTs or ECDSA signatures). This way, your users can still use
your existing login provider. As long as your application follows the JWT specification and uses JWKS for signing whose public keys are exposed by an
endpoint, it should be supported.

## Can XXXX authenticator/login be supported?

The list above isn't comprehensive to all the logins that our system is capable of supporting, if you'd like support for a particular login system do
