#### What is a Verifier?

A verifier is a piece of information about the OAuth provider being used by the application, which is queried by web3auth auth network nodes from a
smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to verify the JWT token.

There are two types of `Verifiers`:

1. `Default Verifiers`: These are the verifiers associated with OAuth providers which are owned and managed by web3auth's account.
2. `Custom Verifiers`: If you want to manage your OAuth providers yourself or to use some Federated Identity Providers like Auth0, Firebase, AWS
   Cognito, Okta etc, you'll have to create a verifier on the Web3Auth's dashboard.

You'll need to create a verifier to let the user login with your custom authentication flow. The Public/Private keys generated for a user are scoped
to a verifier. Verifier scripts determine the access structure to your user's keys, and the set Verifier scripts are chosen to determine which logins
your application will ultimately use.

You can read more about verifiers [in this blog post](https://medium.com/toruslabs/key-assignments-resolution-and-retrieval-afb984500612) or
[in this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/Web3Auth/discussions/427#discussioncomment-3442052).

The `Custom Auth` Dashboard looks something like this:

## Create Verifier

Once you click on the `Create Verifier` button, you'll see a toggle similar to this:

To create a verifier, you need to input the following details:

### Verifier identifier

The identifier for your verifier. This is used to identify your verifier in the Web3Auth dashboard. You'll need this while initialising the
Web3Auth/Web3AuthCore SDK for setting up custom authentication.

### Select Network

Select between `testnet`, `mainnet`, and `cyan`.

- `testnet` is a sandbox environment for developers to experiment. People usually test and finish their integration here.
- `mainnet` & `cyan` is the production environment for scalable applications.

### Login Provider

Select the Login Provider from the list to create a verifier of that type.

The following are the list we have on our Dashboard, if something you're loooking is not available in the list, choose `Custom` and provide the JWT
details.

**Login Providers Setup**

- [Google](/custom-authentication/social-providers/google)

- [Facebook](/custom-authentication/social-providers/facebook)

- [Twitch](/custom-authentication/social-providers/twitch)

- [Discord](/custom-authentication/social-providers/discord)

- [Auth0](/custom-authentication/federated-identity-providers#auth0)

- [Custom JWT](/custom-authentication/byo-jwt-providers)

### Can XXXX authenticator/login be supported?

The list above isn't comprehensive to all the logins that our system is capable of supporting, if you'd like support for a particular login system do
send your query over to hello@web3auth.io.

## Aggregate Verifiers

---

It is possible to combine these attestation methods in AND/OR ways. For example you could combine a Google AND Discord login to access a key or vice
versa can be done for Google OR Discord. For these aggregate verifiers, its important to note that a user's `Verifier ID` must be known ahead of time,
as keys in Web3Auth are append only. Meaning to assign to a key of a user with the aggregate verifier, Google OR Discord, we must know the user's
gmail account and discord account ahead of time.

This disadvantage can be subverted if the two attestation methods share the same `Verifier ID`. For example, Auth0 generic email logins OR Google
logins both use email accounts as the `Verifier ID`, as such the Verifier ID can me shared amonst the two. This is referred to as a Single ID
Verifier.

Reach out to us on our [GitHub Discussion](https://web3auth.io/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/web3auth) to get your aggregate verifier
deployed on our testnet.
