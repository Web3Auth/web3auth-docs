title: Aggregate Verifiers
---

---

A verifier is a unique identifier for your OAuth registration on the torus network. The Public/private keys generated for a user are scoped to a
verifier. The Custom Authentication flow deploys a Verifier Script determining the access structure to your users keys and which logins your
application will ultimately use. You can read more about verifiers
[here](https://medium.com/toruslabs/key-assignments-resolution-and-retrieval-afb984500612).

## Supported Logins

---

Known logins or attestation methods that can be chosen include OAuths and custom logins methods:

| Attestation/Login Method | Lookups | VerifierID Case-sensitive |
| :----------------------- | :------ | :------------------------ |
| Google OAuth2            | Y       | N                         |
| Reddit OAuth2            | Y       | N                         |
| Discord OAuth2           | Y       | Y                         |
| Twitch OAuth2            | N       | Y                         |
| Facebook OAuth2          | N       | Y                         |
| Apple \(Proxy\)          | N       | Y                         |
| Github \(Proxy\)         | Y       | N                         |
| Linkedin \(Proxy\)       | N       | Y                         |
| Weibo \(Proxy\)          | Y       | N                         |
| Twitter \(Proxy\)        | Y       | N                         |
| Line \(Proxy\)           | N       | Y                         |
| Auth0 login              | Depends | Depends                   |
| AWS Cognito              | Depends | Depends                   |
| Custom JWT logins        | Depends | Depends                   |
| Custom ECDSA logins      | Depends | Depends                   |

There are some nuances with certain login providers, so don't hesitate to get in touch to get further details.

## Aggregating Logins/Verifiers

---

It is possible to combine these attestation methods in AND/OR ways. For example you could combine a Google AND Reddit login to access a key. this vice
versa can be done for Google OR Reddit. For these aggregate verifiers, its important to note that a user's verifierID must be known ahead of time, as
keys in Torus are append only. Meaning to assign to a key to a user with the aggregate verifier Google OR Reddit, I must know the users gmail account
and reddit account ahead of time.

This disadvantage can be subverted if the two attestation methods share the same verifierID. For example, Auth0 generic email logins OR Google logins
both use email accounts as the verifierID, as such the verifierID can me shared amonst the two. This is referred to as a Single ID Verifier.

## Using your own custom login provider

---

You can use your own login providers, using one of the custom login schemes \(either via JWTs or ECDSA signatures\). This way, your users can still
use your existing login provider. As long as your application follows the JWT specification and uses JWKS for signing whose public keys are exposed by
an endpoint, it should be supported.

## Can XXXX authenticator/login be supported?

The list above isn't comprehensive to all the logins that our system is capable of supporting, if you'd like support for a particular login system do
