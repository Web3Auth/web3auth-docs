Custom Authentication refers to the capability of hooking up your own custom authentication flow with Web3Auth. This gives you the flexibility of
using any authentication / verification flow you want, providing us the verification token and the user details, and let Web3Auth do the rest, that is
generating a private key for the user, in a self custodial way, resulting in easy onboarding for your users to the dApp.

When building a production application, we recommend you to use Custom Authentication rather than relying on the default authentication Modal provided
by Web3Auth. There are multiple upsides to it:

- It can **provide your users a holistic experience from start to finish**. This is made possible since you own the whole experience and Web3Auth is
  just as a service in the client side.
- You can **customise the data needed from the authentication service** and onboard users according to your requirements. Web3Auth just needs the
  verification token from your side, that's it!
- You can **migrate your existing users into the new auth flow with Web3Auth**, without them needing to create new accounts when you use Custom
  Authentication. Again, just pass on the verification token, we'll create a wallet for them instantly for you!

## Supported Login Providers

---

### Social

Social providers allow you to register your app directly with [implicit grant support ](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/)and use them with
the Web3Auth SDK.

For social providers, you'll also need to set up an application with them to get the Client ID / App ID to use Custom Authentication.

Known logins or attestation methods that can be chosen include OAuths and custom logins methods:

## Suported Login Providers

---

### Social Providers

Social providers allow you to register your app directly with [implicit grant support ](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/)and use them with
Web3Auth. The following are the supported social providers and instructions on how to set up an application with them.

- [Google](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849)
- [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps)
- [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/#registration)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2)

For social providers, you'll need the Client ID / App ID to create a verifier.

### Federated / Identity Providers

Federated / Identity providers enable you to use some [implicit](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/) and
[authorization code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/) grants. You could also use social providers on top of Federated / Identity
providers to select other Social providers (e.g: Twitter, Apple, GitHub, LinkedIn, WeChat etc.) that are not natively suported by us. Note: This will
require you to register an app with the Federated / Identity Providers.

Federated / Identity providers directly supported through Web3Auth Dashboard:

- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/connections)

Other Federated / Identity providers that are also supported, but through
[`Custom` Selection for the Login Providers](./#custom-authentication-providers) on the Web3Auth Dashboard.

- [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/social-login/)
- [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/getting-started/)
- [Firebase](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/client/get-firebase)
- or any OAuth2 compliant login provider

### Bring your own JWT Providers

Bring your own login providers with Web3Auth, using one of the custom login schemes (either via RSA or ECDSA signatures). This way, your users can
still use your existing login provider.

The application should follow the JWT specification and use JWKS for signing the JWT, whose public keys are exposed by an endpoint.

## FAQs

:::tip

**Here are a couple of FAQs that might help you:**

- **Which logins should my application support?**

  - You can select from [this list](./verifiers#supported-logins) or use your own custom authentication. There are some nuances with certain login
    providers, so don't hesitate to get in touch with us.

- **Should different logins lead to the same key?**

  - You can choose to connect logins with the same `Verifier ID`. For example if a user uses generic email logins and a gmail login to login on
    different occasions he/she can still retrieve the same key. This can only be done on logins which share a common unique identifier for a user.

    Read more about aggregating logins [here](./verifiers#aggregating-loginsverifiers).

- **Can XXXX authenticator/login be supported?**

  - Yes, If you'd like support for a particular login system do send your query over to hello@web3auth.io
  - If you have any questions, please get in touch with us on [Telegram](https://t.me/web3auth)
  - We'll be happy to help you out!
