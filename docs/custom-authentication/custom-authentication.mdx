Custom Authentication is a way to authenticate users with your own custom authentication service. For example, you can use a custom authentication
service like Firebase or Auth0 for providing the Web2 authentication aspect which can be passed on to Web3Auth via Verifiers and Web3Auth will proceed
with the process from there.

Using your own authentication service with Web3Auth is one of the best utlisation of our platform. When building a production application, we
recommend you to prefer this approach rather than relying on the default authentication provided by Web3Auth. There are multiple upsides to it:

- Using custom authentication can **provide your users a holistic experience from start to finish**. This is enabled since you own the whole
  experience and Web3Auth is just a service in the client side backend.
- You can **customise the data needed from the authentication service** and onboard users according to your requirements. Web3Auth just needs the
  verification token from your side, that's it!
- You can **migrate your existing users into the new flow with Web3Auth**, without them needing to create new accounts according to our flow. Again,
  just pass on the verification token, we'll create a wallet for them instantly for you!

This guide will further explain how you can utilise Web3Auth to create your custom authentication reference.

# Get Started

---

Using your own authentication service with Web3Auth is actually relatively easy and can be done with not too much code. To get started,

- **Design your Key Management Architecture to decide on which logins ([verifiers](./verifiers)) you'd like to implement, your authentication
  structure and more.**

:::tip

**Here are a couple of questions that might help you there:**

**Which logins should my application support?**

You can select from this [list](./verifiers) or use your own Custom Verifier. There are some nuances with certain login providers, so don't hesitate
to get in touch.

**Should different logins lead to the same key?**

You can choose to connect logins with the same verifierID. For example if a user uses generic email logins and a gmail login to login on different
occasions he/she can still retrieve the same key. This can only be done on logins which share a common unique identifier for a user. Read more about
[aggregating logins](./verifiers).

:::

- **Create your verifier on testnet on the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).** This would require you to similarly setup the
  different logins/auths you have chosen with the respective parties. For example, with Google you need a `clientID`. Any generic OAuth follow the
  details (here)[./verifiers]The process is fairly strightforward and you can view it [here](/get-started/using-dashboard#creating-a-verifier).
- **Make sure to convert/ deploy your verifier to mainnet, before entering into production.**

# Setting up Verifiers on the Developer Dashboard

---

To setup verifiers, you need to visit the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) and navigate to the Custom Auth section. Once you click
on the `Create Verifier` button, you'll see a toggle similar to this:

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Image1} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>
<br />
To create a verifier, you need to input the following details:

## Verifier identifier

---

The identifier for your verifier. This is used to identify your verifier in the Web3Auth dashboard. You'll need this while initialising the
Web3AuthCore SDK for setting up custom login.

## Select Network

---

Select between `testnet` and `mainnet`. `testnet` is a sandbox environment for developers to experiment. People usually test and finish their
integration here. `mainnet` is production environment for scalable applications.

## Verifier Type

---

Select the type of verifier you want to create. Here are the different kind of login providers that we currently support:

### Native Providers

Native providers allow you to register your app directly with [implicit grant support ](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/)and use them with
Torus. The following are the supported native providers and instructions on how to set up an application with them.

- [Google](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849)
- [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps)
- [Reddit](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/oauth2)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2)
- [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/#registration)

For native providers, you'll need the client ID / app ID to create a verifier.

### Proxy Providers

Proxy providers enable you to use some non-implicit type logins. \(e.g: Twitter, Apple, GitHub, LinkedIn, Email-Password, Magic link, WeChat etc.\)
and require you to register an app with them.

Some examples of proxy providers:

- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/connections)
- [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/social-login/)
- [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/getting-started/)
- or any custom OAuth2 compliant login provider

### Custom Verifiers

You can use your own login providers with Web3Auth, using one of the custom login schemes (either via RSA or ECDSA signatures). This way, your users
can still use your existing login provider. The application should follow the JWT specification and use JWKS for signing whose public keys are exposed
by an endpoint.

Head over to [**developer dashboard**](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) to get started with creating a custom verifier.

To create a custom verifier, you'll need

#### 1. JWT Verifier ID

JWT Verifier ID is the unique identifier to publicly represent a user on a verifier.

e.g: email, sub etc.

#### 2. JWK Endpoint

An endpoint containing the JWKS used for signing.

> Output of jwk endpoint should contain same fields as the example given below.

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "RSA",
      "e": "AQAB",
      "use": "sig",
      "kid": "1bb9605c36e98e30117a69517569386830202b2d",
      "n": "pAbfKmQ1ljT6yZcrdxaJxqsB7EupbBFcCLiMzmuFQMuk3y_g-vVPR8ZwTJbalwBxD-vUPmxmZAVok_iNthw1mnW0POg3kEwtl1qambgNKlaTeO8S3D-KGlUNV6bU-JXbyquds7v8bQjmIQ5oXhwIQt6x55bEyZTOCQDl3ZHy1XxeBWFyiPUXXnqkO51EFeVNiMi8Ihue16UY_lIizhivl2C_UwJ0Ymx9eWJ-nefPBo7Lr_fIxh81NaLMB6t5L8123RSIaaIcR_r1H_ZbEe9VNTfnGdYS3A0u-pNS_bm5jRSBo1qt01OFu0xEsjcO7-NESTBr8w8SUqGK86tg9oQz5w",

    },
    {

      "e": "AQAB",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "kid": "c53624af1600da79f31f0314f205d4f37ad6e246",
      "use": "sig",
      "n": "sinuWOLB7u0NoJ5Cy92AUqC7clH0ErjTjrI_b_dBbndg0rrFZryKfbvH4ncZW_yQ9izl2mjLsjsBzVwAyzWIn83QRhTtisdV7k9AkhSGdNu-cG_qPkedhqFPIn_uyBnVpxksp8clMRALetdHncUqcTfhIpngQp_JxFHle0fNsylU510fH-iZfphLO9mMpq6eB5QGynttgpdsLxLuXe1CffNQya0pmtLkU4ATfVdXV_bMqzRxxbDOnzIaLjzUJdsMuScCTjQX93xdfzEu-Vk6zOpdkrBRUuopgAX1e8NPQz150XEOTInkh0Mfhw0t1GeB7zbbjYJDmCgYTIW1g4teBw"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. JWT Validations

These are the claims against which a JWT is validated.

- Token Audience ( <code>aud</code> ):

The audience is your verifier's Applicaiton ID, assigned to your verifier on torus-network. The <code>aud</code> value is a case-sensitive string
containing a StringOrURI value. Use of this claim is MANDATORY.

- Token Issuer ( <code>iss</code> ):

The issuing authority of the token. The <code>iss</code> value is a case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI value. Use of this claim is
OPTIONAL.

You can add upto 3 validations; including any custom claims like <code>email_verified</code> etc.

:::note

Your jwt token payload data must contain `iat` field.
