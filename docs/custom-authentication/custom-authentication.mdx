Custom Authentication refers to the capability of hooking up your own custom authentication flow with Web3Auth. This gives you the flexibility of
using any authentication / verification flow you want, providing us the verification token and the user details, and let Web3Auth do the rest, that is
generating a private key for the user, in a self custodial way, resulting in easy onboarding for your users to the dApp.

## Supported Logins

---

Known logins or attestation methods that can be chosen include OAuths and custom logins methods:

| Attestation/Login Method | Lookups | Verifier ID Case-sensitive |
| :----------------------- | :------ | :------------------------- |

## Suported Login Providers

### Social Providers

Social providers allow you to register your app directly with [implicit grant support ](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/)and use them with
Web3Auth. The following are the supported social providers and instructions on how to set up an application with them.

- [Google](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849)
- [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps)
- [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/#registration)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2)

For social providers, you'll need the Client ID / App ID to create a verifier.

### Federated / Identity Providers

Federated / Identity providers enable you to use some [implicit](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/) and
[authorization code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/) grants. You could also use social providers on top of Federated / Identity
providers to select other Social providers (e.g: Twitter, Apple, GitHub, LinkedIn, WeChat etc.) that are not natively suported by us. Note: This will
require you to register an app with the Federated / Identity Providers.

Federated / Identity providers directly supported through Web3Auth Dashboard:

- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/connections)

Other Federated / Identity providers that are also supported, but through
[`Custom` Selection for the Login Providers](./#custom-authentication-providers) on the Web3Auth Dashboard.

- [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/social-login/)
- [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/getting-started/)
- [Firebase](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/client/get-firebase)
- or any OAuth2 compliant login provider

### Bring your own JWT Providers

Bring your own login providers with Web3Auth, using one of the custom login schemes (either via RSA or ECDSA signatures). This way, your users can
still use your existing login provider.

The application should follow the JWT specification and use JWKS for signing the JWT, whose public keys are exposed by an endpoint.

## Aggregating Verifiers

---

It is possible to combine these attestation methods in AND/OR ways. For example you could combine a Google AND Discord login to access a key. this
vice versa can be done for Google OR Discord. For these aggregate verifiers, its important to note that a user's `Verifier ID` must be known ahead of
time, as keys in Torus are append only. Meaning to assign to a key to a user with the aggregate verifier Google OR Discord, we must know the users
gmail account and twitch account ahead of time.

This disadvantage can be subverted if the two attestation methods share the same `Verifier ID`. For example, Auth0 generic email logins OR Google
logins both use email accounts as the `Verifier ID`, as such the Verifier ID can me shared amonst the two. This is referred to as a Single ID
Verifier.

Using your own authentication service with Web3Auth is one of the best utlisation of our platform. When building a production application, we
recommend you to prefer this approach rather than relying on the default authentication provided by Web3Auth. There are multiple upsides to it:

- Using custom authentication can **provide your users a holistic experience from start to finish**. This is enabled since you own the whole
  experience and Web3Auth is just a service in the client side backend.
- You can **customise the data needed from the authentication service** and onboard users according to your requirements. Web3Auth just needs the
  verification token from your side, that's it!
- You can **migrate your existing users into the new flow with Web3Auth**, without them needing to create new accounts according to our flow. Again,
  just pass on the verification token, we'll create a wallet for them instantly for you!

## FAQs

:::tip

**Here are a couple of FAQs that might help you:**

- **Which logins should my application support?**

  - You can select from [this list](./verifiers#supported-logins) or use your own custom authentication. There are some nuances with certain login
    providers, so don't hesitate to get in touch with us.

- **Should different logins lead to the same key?**

  - You can choose to connect logins with the same `Verifier ID`. For example if a user uses generic email logins and a gmail login to login on
    different occasions he/she can still retrieve the same key. This can only be done on logins which share a common unique identifier for a user.
