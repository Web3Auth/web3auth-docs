Custom Authentication refers to the capability of hooking up your own custom authentication flow with Web3Auth. We recommend you to use Custom
Authentication rather than relying on the default authentication Modal provided by Web3Auth.

Upsides to using it are:

- **Provides holistic user experience from start to finish**.
- **Customise the data needed from the authentication service** and onboard users according to your requirements.
- **Migrate your existing users into the new auth flow with Web3Auth**, without them needing to create new accounts.

## Supported Login Providers

### Social

<SocialTiles />

### Federated / Identity Providers

<FederatedTiles />

#### Social via Federated/Identity Providers

<SocialViaFederatedTiles />

### Bring your own Custom Login Providers

:::caution

For a Custom JWT based authentication services you need to use the [`Web3Auth Plug and Play Core SDK`](/sdk/web/core/), since the Web3Auth Modal will
only help you configure the social logins present within the Modal UI.

## Suported Login Providers

---

### Social Providers

Social providers allow you to register your app directly with [implicit grant support ](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/)and use them with
Web3Auth. The following are the supported social providers and instructions on how to set up an application with them.

- [Google](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849)
- [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps)
- [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/#registration)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2)

For social providers, you'll need the Client ID / App ID to create a verifier.

### Federated / Identity Providers

Federated / Identity providers enable you to use some [implicit](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/) and
[authorization code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/) grants. You could also use social providers on top of Federated / Identity
providers to select other Social providers (e.g: Twitter, Apple, GitHub, LinkedIn, WeChat etc.) that are not natively suported by us. Note: This will
require you to register an app with the Federated / Identity Providers.

Federated / Identity providers directly supported through Web3Auth Dashboard:

- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/connections)

Other Federated / Identity providers that are also supported, but through
[`Custom` Selection for the Login Providers](./#custom-authentication-providers) on the Web3Auth Dashboard.

- [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/social-login/)
- [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/getting-started/)
- [Firebase](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/client/get-firebase)
- or any OAuth2 compliant login provider

### Bring your own JWT Providers

Bring your own login providers with Web3Auth, using one of the custom login schemes (either via RSA or ECDSA signatures). This way, your users can
still use your existing login provider.

The application should follow the JWT specification and use JWKS for signing the JWT, whose public keys are exposed by an endpoint.

## FAQs

---

:::tip

**Here are a couple of FAQs that might help you:**

- **Which logins should my application support?**

  - You can select from [this list](./verifiers#supported-logins) or use your own custom authentication. There are some nuances with certain login
    providers, so don't hesitate to get in touch with us.

- **Should different logins lead to the same key?**

  - You can choose to connect logins with the same `Verifier ID`. For example if a user uses generic email logins and a gmail login to login on
    different occasions he/she can still retrieve the same key. This can only be done on logins which share a common unique identifier for a user.

    Read more about aggregating logins [here](./verifiers#aggregating-loginsverifiers).

- **Can XXXX authenticator/login be supported?**

  - Yes, If you'd like support for a particular login system do send your query over to hello@web3auth.io
  - If you have any questions, please get in touch with us on [Telegram](https://t.me/web3auth)
  - We'll be happy to help you out!
