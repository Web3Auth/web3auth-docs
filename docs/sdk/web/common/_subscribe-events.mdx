#### `on(EVENT, CALLBACK)`

Subscribing to events help you trigger responses based on the status of the connection of the user. An adapter emits certain events like `CONNECTED`,
`CONNECTING` and `DISCONNECTED` etc during login lifecycle of a user. For example, you can use this to show an error message, if the user is not
connected to the network. Generally, this is not a required step and should be done only if needed in particular cases.

:::note

If you're using the `uxMode: "redirect"` option within your [`openlogin-adapter`](../openlogin) configuration, you need to subscribe to the event to
handle the logging in implicitly. This is because, when redirected to a different application, the app state is not updated as per the login status.
Using a lifecycle method to check this, one can easily handle the login status within the constructor function.

Web3Auth provides the following lifecycle event to check the login status:
