The default adapter of Web3Auth is the [`openlogin-adapter`](../openlogin). This adapter is a wrapper around the [`openlogin`](../openlogin) library
from Web3Auth and enables the social login features. For customising features of the main Web3Auth flow, like [Whitelabel](./whitelabel),
[Custom Authentication](./custom-authentication), etc. you need to customise the Openlogin Adapter.

:::tip

Checkout the [`openlogin-adapter`](../openlogin) SDK Reference for more details on different configurations you can pass for customisations.

#### Whitelabeling

##### `whiteLabel`

For customising the redirect screens while logging in and constructing the key, you need to pass on `whiteLabel` configurations to the
`adapterSettings` property of the [`openlogin-adapter`](../openlogin).

:::tip

This is just one of the aspects of whitelabeling you can achieve with Web3Auth. To know more in depth about how you can Whitelabel your application
with Web3Auth, have a look at our [Whitelabeling SDK Reference](./whitelabel).

##### Example

<OpenloginWhiteLabelExample />

#### Custom Authentication

##### `loginConfig`

With Web3Auth, you have the option to configure logins using your own authentication services. For adding your own authentication, you have to first
configure your verifiers in the Web3Auth Dashboard. Have a look at our [Custom Authentication Documentation](/docs/custom-authentication/) for
configuring that first.

Custom Authentication in Web3Auth is supported by the Openlogin Adapter, which is the default adapter for the Web3Auth SDK. For this, you need to
configure the `loginConfig` parameter in the `adapterSettings` of the `openlogin-adapter` package.

:::tip

Refer to the [Custom Authentication Documentation](./custom-authentication) for more information.
