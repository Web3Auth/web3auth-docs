Custom Authentication is a way to authenticate users with your own custom authentication service. For example, while authenticating with Google, you
have the ability to use your own Google Client ID and Dashboard to authenticate users directly.

:::caution

For a Custom JWT based authentication services you need to use the [`Web3Auth Plug and Play Core SDK`](../core), since the Web3Auth Modal will only
help you configure the social logins present within the Modal UI.

:::

For enabling this, you need [Create a Verifier](/custom-authentication/verifiers) from the **Custom Auth** section of the
[Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/home/customauth) with your desired configuration.

:::tip

If you want to know more about setting up a verifier and how to use it, please refer to the
[Custom Authentication Documentation](/custom-authentication).

## Installing Openlogin Adapter

---

Social logins in Web3Auth are enabled by the [`openlogin-adapter`](../openlogin). Natively, it is already present and preconfigured within the Plug
and Play SDK, but for custom configurations, you need to install the adapter package.

<OpenloginAdapterInstall />

## Configuring Openlogin Adapter

---

While instantiating the Openlogin Adapter, you can pass some configuration objects to the constructor. One of these configurations is the
`adapterSettings` configuration which enables you to make changes in the adapter, enabling you to do things like Whitelabeling and Custom
Authentication among other things.

:::tip

Checkout the [`openlogin-adapter`](../openlogin) SDK Reference for more details on different configurations you can pass for customisations.

:::

Further, the `loginConfig` parameter of the `adapterSettings` configuration helps us to customise the social logins. Since we're using the
`@web3auth/web3auth`, ie. the Plug and Play UI SDK, the `loginConfig` should be corresponding to the socials mentioned in the modal. This means you
can use your own authentication services for the following services:

`google` | `facebook` | `twitter` | `reddit` | `discord` | `twitch` | `apple` | `line` | `github` | `kakao` | `linkedin` | `weibo` | `wechat` |
`passwordless`

:::info

You can customise all or few of the social logins and other will remain default. You can also remove the ones you don't want using the whitelabeling
option.

:::

#### `loginConfig`

The `loginConfig` parameter of `adapterSettings` in `openlogin-adapter` contains the following properties:

<LoginConfig />

## Example

---

Since we're using the `@web3auth/web3auth` ie. the Plug and Play UI SDK, the `loginConfig` should be corresponding to the socials mentioned in the
modal. Here, we're customising Google and Facebook to be custom verified, rest all other socials will be default.
