# Web3Auth Plug and Play UI

---

## [`@web3auth/web3auth`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/web3auth)

import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";

This package provides main class for using default Web3Auth Modal. The package includes all of our packages and gives you a simple way of implementing
Web3Auth within your interface. Additionally, it is a child class of [`@web3auth/core`](../core) package. Hence, you can still call all the functions
available in the [`@web3auth/core`](../core) package.

## Installation

---

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: "npm", value: "npm" },
    { label: "yarn", value: "yarn" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/web3auth
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @web3auth/web3auth
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Consider adding `@web3auth/base` to your project

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: "npm", value: "npm" },
    { label: "yarn", value: "yarn" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @web3auth/base
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you
need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with `Typescript`.
