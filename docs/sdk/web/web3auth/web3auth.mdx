# Web3Auth Plug and Play UI

---

## [`@web3auth/web3auth`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/web3auth)

This package provides main class for using default Web3Auth Modal. The package includes all of our packages and gives you a simple way of implementing
Web3Auth within your interface. Additionally, it is a child class of [`@web3auth/core`](/sdk/web/core) package. Hence, you can still call all the
functions available in the [`@web3auth/core`](/sdk/web/core) package.

## Installation

---

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/web3auth
```

### Consider adding `@web3auth/base` to your project

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you
need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with `Typescript`.
