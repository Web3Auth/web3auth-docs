Once you've installed and successfully initialized `Web3AuthCore`, you can use it to authenticate your users. Further, you can use the native provider
given by `Web3AuthCore` to connect the users to the respective blockchain network.

Natively, the instance of `Web3AuthCore` _(referred to as `web3auth` in our examples)_ returns the following functions:

- `connectTo()` - Logging in the User with the given Wallet Adapter and respective Login Parameters
- `getUserInfo()` - Getting the User's Information
- `logout()` - Logging out the User

## Logging in the User

---

<ConnectTo />

#### `walletName`

<WalletAdapters />

#### `loginParams`

The `loginParams` are specific for each and every function. Please refer to the [Adapters SDK Reference](../adapters) to know more about the login
parameters specific to each wallet adapter.

For `openlogin-adapter` which enables the social logins, you can reference to the following `loginParams`.

<OpenloginLoginParams />

Further, for Custom Authentication, `ExtraLoginOptions` can be used to pass the standard oauth login options.

<ExtraLoginOptions />

#### Returns

```ts
connectTo<T>(walletName: WALLET_ADAPTER_TYPE, loginParams?: T): Promise<SafeEventEmitterProvider | null>;
```

#### Example

<ConnectToExample />

On successful connection, the `connect()` function returns a `SafeEventEmitterProvider` instance. This instance contains the respective provider
corresponding to your selected blockchain. You can use this provider to connect your user to the blockchain and make transactions.

:::tip

Read more about connecting your users with the selected blockchain in the [Providers SDK Reference](../providers).

On unsuccessful login, this function will return a `null` value.
