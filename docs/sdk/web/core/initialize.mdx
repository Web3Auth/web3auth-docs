After Installation, the next step to use Web3Auth is to Initialize the SDK. However, the Initialization is a two step process, with additional two
steps for customisations, ie.

- [Instantiation of Web3AuthCore](#instantiating-web3authcore)
- [Configuration of Adapters](#configuring-adapters) _(optional)_
- [Configuration of Plugins](#configuring-plugins) _(optional)_
- [Initialization of Web3Auth](#initializing-web3auth)

Please note that these are the most critical steps where you need to pass on different parameters according to the preference of your project.
Additionally, Whitelabeling and Custom Authentication have to be configured within this step, if you wish to customise your Web3Auth Instance.

## Instantiating Web3AuthCore

---

#### Import the `Web3AuthCore` class from `@web3auth/core`

```javascript
import Web3AuthCore from "@web3auth/core";
```

#### Assign the `Web3AuthCore` class to a variable

```javascript
const web3auth = new Web3AuthCore(Web3AuthCoreOptions);
```

This Web3AuthCore constructor takes an object with `Web3AuthCoreOptions` as input.

### Arguments

#### `Web3AuthCoreOptions`

<Web3AuthCoreOptions />

### Adding a Custom Chain Configuration

#### `chainConfig`

<ChainConfig />

### Returns

- `Object`: The web3auth instance with all its methods and events.

### Example

```javascript
const web3auth = new Web3AuthCore({
  chainConfig: {
    chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155,
    chainId: "0x1",
    rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth", // This is the mainnet RPC we have added, please pass on your own endpoint while creating an app
  },
});
```

## Configuring Adapters

---

Adapter is a pluggable package which implements `IAdapter` interface for a wallet within Web3Auth. An adapter can be plugged in and out of web3auth
modal. Each adapter exposes provider on successful user login which can be used to invoke RPC calls on wallet and on connected blockchain. You can
configure and use any of the adapters provided by Web3Auth, by just configuring them while initialising Web3AuthCore.

:::info

This step is generally optional. You don't have to configure any adapter unless you want to use their functionality with Web3Auth or want to override
the default settings.

### Configuring Openlogin Adapter

<OpenloginAdapterIntro />

##### Example

Since we're using the `@web3auth/core`, ie. the Plug and Play Core SDK, the `loginConfig` can include custom JWT based authentication as well. This
way, we can use any of our preferred login provider and further setup their configs while logging the user in and passing over the `extraLoginOptions`
in the `connectTo` function. Read more about this this in the [Custom Authentication Guide](./custom-authentication).

### Configuring External Wallet Adapters

<ExternalWalletAdapters />

### Subscribing the Lifecycle Events

<SubscribeEvents />

## Configuring Plugins

### Example

## Initializing Web3Auth

#### `init()`

The final step in the whole initialization process is the initialize the `Web3AuthCore` instance, ie. `web3auth` in our case.

This is done by calling `init` function of the `web3auth` instance we created above.

```javascript
await web3auth.init();
```

This is a simple function, that doesn't take any input, nor does return anything. It just makes sure that the `web3auth` instance is initialized and
ready for the user to login.
