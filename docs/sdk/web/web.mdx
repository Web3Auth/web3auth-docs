For using Web3Auth in the web, you have two choices of SDKs to get started with.

- **Web3Auth Plug and Play UI SDK [`@web3auth/web3auth`](./web3auth/):** A simple and easy to use SDK that will give you a simple modular way of
  implementing Web3Auth directly within your application. You can use the pre-configured Web3Auth Modal UI and whitelabel it according to your needs.

- **Web3Auth Plug and Play Core SDK [`@web3auth/core`](./core):** The core module implemeting all the Web3Auth features you need and giving you the
  flexibilty of using your own UI with the Web3Auth SDK working in the backend.

## Web3Auth Plug and Play UI SDK

---

### [`@web3auth/web3auth`](./web3auth)

This package provides main class for using default Web3Auth Modal. The package includes all of our packages and gives you a simple way of implementing
Web3Auth within your interface. Additionally, it is a child class of [`@web3auth/core`](./core) package. Hence, you can still call all the functions
available in the [`@web3auth/core`](./core) package.

Head on to the [`@web3auth/web3auth` SDK Reference](./web3auth) section to get started.

## Web3Auth Plug and Play Core SDK

---

### [`@web3auth/core`](./core)

This package provides the core logic for handling adapters within Web3auth. This package acts as a manager for all the wallet adapters we offer. You
should use this package to build your custom login UI on top of Web3Auth. The SDK size for this is comparatively smaller than the Plug and Play UI
SDK, since it doesn't have the Web3Auth Modal UI within it.

## Provider packages

---

For making RPC calls within your dApp, Web3Auth exposes a respective providers for different chains. This provider can be used to interact with the
connected chain using exposed functions within the provider. Currently Web3Auth supports providers for both EVM and Solana chains. For other chains,
one can easily get the private key from the Web3Auth SDK.

Checkout the [Providers SDK Reference](./providers) to learn more.

- [For EVM based Chains `@web3auth/ethereum-provider`](./providers/evm)
- [For Solana Blockchain `@web3auth/solana-provider`](./providers/solana)
- [Default Provider for all other Blockchains](./providers/other)

## Plugin packages

Plugins extend the functionality of Web3Auth, helping you to add more features to your application. These features can be used to extend the UI
functionalities, making your Web3Auth instance more interoperable, adding wallet features and a lot more!

Currently, we support UI plugins for wallet operations, helping you with flows to add funds, manage transactions, provide wallet UI and much more.
This helps you avoid making wallet flows within your application. Additionally, for interoperability with multiple applications, these packages give
you the advantage of using the same key from Web3Auth across multiple applications.

- [`@web3auth/torus-wallet-connector-plugin`](./plugins/torus-wallet)
- [`@web3auth/solana-wallet-connector-plugin`](./plugins/solana-wallet)

## Adapter packages

---

Adapter acts as a connector between the Web3Auth and an underlying wallet provider. For logging a user in through socials, Web3Auth uses the default
[`openlogin-adapter`](./adapters/openlogin). For the rest of the external wallets, every adapter follows a common interface which is required by
Web3Auth to communicate with the wallet.

:::tip

Checkout the [Adapters SDK Reference](./adapters) to learn more.

Currently we have the following adapters available for utilisation:

- [`@web3auth/openlogin-adapter`](./openlogin) _**- default** (Enables social logins)_
- [`@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter`](./adapters/torus-evm)
- [`@web3auth/torus-solana-adapter`](./adapters/torus-solana)
- [`@web3auth/metamask-adapter`](./adapters/metamask)
- [`@web3auth/phantom-adapter`](./adapters/phantom)
- [`@web3auth/wallet-connect-v1-adapter`](./adapters/wallet-connect-v1)
- [`@web3auth/coinbase-adapter`](./adapters/coinbase-adapter)
- [`@web3auth/slope-adapter`](./adapters/slope-adapter)
- [`@web3auth/solflare-adapter`](./adapters/solflare-adapter)
- [`@web3auth/sollet-adapter`](./adapters/sollet-connect-v1)

## Other Packages

---

### [`@web3auth/base`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/base)

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you
need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with Typescript.

### [`@web3auth/ui`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/ui)

This package includes the default Web3Auth modal UI for modular access within the Plug n Play SDK. It is included as a dependency in our Plug n Play
SDK.
