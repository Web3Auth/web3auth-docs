[Custom Authentication](/features/custom-authentication) is a way to authenticate users with your
custom authentication service. For example, while authenticating with Google, you can use your own
Google Client ID and Dashboard to authenticate users directly or use aggregator services like Auth0,
Firebase, AWS Cognito etc. Additionally, you can make your own JWT token authentication system and
pass the ID Token to Web3Auth to generate a private key for them.

To enable this, you need to [Create a Verifier](/auth-provider-setup/verifiers) from the **Custom
Authentication** tab of your project from the
[Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) with your desired configuration.

## Installing Auth Adapter

---

Social logins in Web3Auth are enabled by the [`auth-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth). Natively,
it is already present and preconfigured within the Plug and Play SDK, but for custom configurations,
you need to install the adapter package.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/auth-adapter
```

## Configuring Auth Adapter

While instantiating the Auth Adapter, you can pass some configuration objects to the constructor.
One of these configurations is the `adapterSettings` configuration which enables you to make changes
in the adapter, enabling you to do things like Whitelabeling and Custom Authentication among other
things.

:::tip

Checkout the [`auth-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth) SDK Reference for more details on
different configurations you can pass for customizations.

:::

#### `loginConfig`

The `loginConfig` parameter of `adapterSettings` in `auth-adapter` contains the following
properties:

<LoginConfig />

## Logging In

While using the Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK, you have the option to use the `connectTo`
function, which enables you to customize the login process according to the parameters you have for
your custom authentication service.

<ConnectTo />

:::tip

Know more about the `connectTo` function in the
[`Usage SDK Reference`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal/usage#logging-in-the-user)

:::

:::important

It is mandatory to pass the `idToken` parameter in the `extraLoginOptions` object when logging in
through your [`Custom JWT Token`](/auth-provider-setup/byo-jwt-provider/).

:::

Further, to enable Custom Authentication, the `loginParams` parameter takes in another object called
`extraLoginOptions` which contains the following properties:

<ExtraLoginOptions />

## Example

Since we're using the `@web3auth/no-modal`, ie. the Plug and Play No Modal SDK, the `loginConfig`
can include custom JWT-based authentication as well. This way, we can use any of our preferred login
providers and further setup their configs while logging the user in and passing over the
`extraLoginOptions` in the `connectTo` function.

### Single Verifier

### Aggregate Verifier

```tsx
import { AuthAdapter } from "@web3auth/auth-adapter";

const authAdapter = new AuthAdapter({
  adapterSettings: {
    // focus-start
    loginConfig: {
      // Google login
      google: {
        verifier: "YOUR_AGGREGATE_VERIFIER_NAME", // Please create an aggregate verifier on the developer dashboard and pass the name here
        verifierSubIdentifier: "YOUR_SUB_VERIFIER_NAME", // Pass in the sub verifier name here
        typeOfLogin: "google", // Pass on the login provider of the verifier you've created
        clientId: "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID", // based on sub verifier, pass in the clientId of the login provider here - Please note this differs from the Web3Auth ClientID.
      },
      github: {
        verifier: "YOUR_AGGREGATE_VERIFIER_NAME", // Please create an aggregate verifier on the developer dashboard and pass the name here
        verifierSubIdentifier: "YOUR_SUB_VERIFIER_NAME", // Pass in the sub verifier name here
        typeOfLogin: "github", // Pass on the login provider of the verifier you've created
        clientId: "YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID", // based on sub verifier, pass in the clientId of the login provider here - Please note this differs from the Web3Auth ClientID.
      },
    },
    // focus-end
  },
  privateKeyProvider,
});
web3auth.configureAdapter(authAdapter);
```

```tsx
// When user clicks Google button, use this to Login with Google
const web3authProvider = await web3auth.connectTo("auth", {
  loginProvider: "google",
});

// When user clicks GitHub button, use this to Login with GitHub via Auth0
const web3authProvider = await web3auth.connectTo("auth", {
  loginProvider: "github",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    domain: "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN", // Pass the Auth0 Domain here, eg. https://web3auth.au.auth0.com
    // This corresponds to the field inside jwt which must be used to uniquely identify the user.
    verifierIdField: "YOUR_AUTH0_VERIFIER_ID_FIELD", // This is mapped b/w google and github logins.
    isVerifierIdCaseSensitive: true, // only if the verifier id is case sensitive, else remove this line
  },
});
```
