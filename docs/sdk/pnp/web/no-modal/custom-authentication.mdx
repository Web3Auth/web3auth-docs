Custom Authentication is a way to authenticate users with your own custom authentication service. For example, while authenticating with Google, you
have the ability to use your own Google Client ID and Dashboard to authenticate users directly, or use aggregate services like Auth0, Firebase, AWS
Cognito etc. Additionally, you can make your own JWT token authentication system and pass over the ID Token to the Web3Auth to generate a private key
for them.

For enabling this, you need [Create a Verifier](/auth-provider-setup/verifiers) from the **Custom Auth** section of the

[Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) with your desired configuration.

If you want to know more about setting up a verifier and how to use it, please refer to the
[Custom Authentication Documentation](/pnp/features/custom-authentication).

## Installing Openlogin Adapter

---

Social logins in Web3Auth are enabled by the [`openlogin-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin). Natively, it is already present and preconfigured
within the Plug and Play SDK, but for custom configurations, you need to install the adapter package.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/openlogin-adapter
```

## Configuring Openlogin Adapter

While instantiating the Openlogin Adapter, you can pass some configuration objects to the constructor. One of these configurations is the
`adapterSettings` configuration which enables you to make changes in the adapter, enabling you to do things like Whitelabeling and Custom
Authentication among other things.

:::tip

Checkout the [`openlogin-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin) SDK Reference for more details on different configurations you can pass for
customisations.

:::

#### `loginConfig`

The `loginConfig` parameter of `adapterSettings` in `openlogin-adapter` contains the following properties:

<LoginConfig />

## Logging in through your Custom JWT Token

While using the Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK, you have the option to use the `connectTo` function, that enables you to customise the login
process according to the parameters you have for your custom authentication service.

<ConnectTo />

:::tip

Know more about the `connectTo` function in the [`Usage SDK Reference`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal/usage#logging-in-the-user)

:::

Further, to enable Custom Authentication, the `loginParams` parameter takes in another object called `extraLoginOptions` which contains the following
properties:

<ExtraLoginOptions />

## Example

Since we're using the `@web3auth/no-modal`, ie. the Plug and Play No Modal SDK, the `loginConfig` can include custom JWT based authentication as well.
This way, we can use any of our preferred login provider and further setup their configs while logging the user in and passing over the
`extraLoginOptions` in the `connectTo` function.
