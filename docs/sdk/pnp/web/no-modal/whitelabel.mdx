Web3Auth is fully whitelabelable with application branding to have a consistent user experience. All our SDKs support Whitelabeling, giving granular
customisation capability across all our offerings. The major benefit with the Plug and Play No Modal SDK is the flexibility in how you can make your
own UI for triggerring the login. Further, Whitelabeling enables you to customise the other aspects as well.

Within the Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK, whitelabeling can happen in 2 different places,

- [**Openlogin Adapter**](#openlogin-adapter): The redirect screens while logging in and constructing the key, can be customised according to your
  pcommon as well. For this you need to pass on the `whiteLabel` configuration parameter to the
  [`openlogin-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin).
- [**Torus Wallet Plugin**](#torus-wallet-plugin): The Torus Wallet Plugin can be customised according to your needs for helping you make wallet flows
  within your application. For this you need to pass on the `torusWalletOpts` configuration.

## Openlogin Adapter

Web3Auth's Social Logins and Email Login runs using the OpenLogin Flow. The whole OpenLogin user experience can also be whitelabeled using OpenLogin
Adapter settings. For this you need to pass on the `whiteLabel` configuration parameter to the `adapterSettings` property of the
[`openlogin-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin).

Checkout the [`openlogin-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin) SDK Reference for more details on different configurations you can pass for
customisations.
