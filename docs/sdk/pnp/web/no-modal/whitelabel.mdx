Web3Auth is fully whitelabelable with application branding to have a consistent user experience. All
our SDKs support Whitelabeling, giving granular customization capability across all our offerings.
The major benefit of the Plug and Play No Modal SDK is the flexibility in how you can make your own
UI for triggering the login. Further, Whitelabeling enables you to customize the other aspects as
well.

### NEW: Whitelabeling via the Dashboard

From version `8.5.0`, **Web3Auth's No Modal Plug and Play SDK** offers whitelabeling capabilities
via the **Dashboard**. This enables developers to customize the logo, appName and translations to
align with their application's branding and user experience requirements.

- **Customize the Logo and App Name:** Modify the logo and application name to align with your
  application's branding.
- **Configure Language and Translations:** Customize the language and translations within the
  authentication flow to cater to your target audience.

Within the Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK, whitelabeling can happen in 2 different places,

- [**Auth Adapter**](#auth-adapter): The redirect screens while logging in and constructing the key,
  can be customized according to your common as well. For this, you need to pass on the `whiteLabel`
  configuration parameter to the [`auth-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth).
- [**uiConfig**](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal/initialize#whitelabeling): The UI components can be
  customized using the `uiConfig` parameter while initializing the Web3AuthNoModal SDK.

## Auth Adapter

Web3Auth's Social Logins and Email Login run using the Auth Flow. The whole Auth user experience can
also be whitelabeled using Auth Adapter settings. For this, you need to pass on the `whiteLabel`
configuration parameter to the `adapterSettings` property of the
[`auth-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth).

:::tip

Checkout the [`auth-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth) SDK Reference for more details on
different configurations you can pass for customizations.

### Example

<AuthWhiteLabelExample />

## uiConfig

The UI components can be customized using the `uiConfig` parameter while initializing the
Web3AuthNoModal SDK. The `uiConfig` parameter is a `WhiteLabelData` object which can be used to
customize the UI components.

### Example

```tsx
import { Web3AuthNoModal } from "@web3auth/no-modal";
import { WhiteLabelData } from "@web3auth/base";

// focus-start
const uiConfig: WhiteLabelData = {
  appName: "My App",
  appURL: "https://example.com",
  logoLight: "https://example.com/logo-light.png",
  logoDark: "https://example.com/logo-dark.png",
  defaultLanguage: "en",
  mode: "light",
  useLogoLoader: true,
  theme: {
    primary: "#FF0000",
    secondary: "#00FF00",
    warning: "#FFA500",
  },
  tncLink: "https://example.com/terms",
  privacyPolicy: "https://example.com/privacy",
};
// focus-end

const web3auth = new Web3AuthNoModal({
  clientId: "", // Get your Client ID from the Web3Auth Dashboard
  chainConfig,
  web3AuthNetwork: "sapphire_mainnet",
  privateKeyProvider,
  // focus-start
  uiConfig,
  // focus-end
});
```
