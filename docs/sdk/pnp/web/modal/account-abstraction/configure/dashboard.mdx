To enable the Smart Accounts feature, navigate to the Smart Accounts section in the Web3Auth
dashboard, and enable the Set up Smart Accounts toggle. Web3Auth currently supports
[MetaMaskSmartAccount](https://docs.gator.metamask.io/how-to/create-delegator-account#create-a-metamasksmartaccount)
as a Smart Account provider.

## Wallet configuration

Once Smart Accounts are enabled, the wallet configurations can be customized. By default,
`All supported wallets` is selected, allowing users to also create Smart Accounts using external
wallets.

To restrict this behavior, the configuration can be set to `Embedded wallets only`.

## Configure Bundler

Web3Auth allows developers to configure a custom bundler, which aggregates UserOperations and
submits them on-chain via the global EntryPoint contract.

To define a paymaster context for an ERC-20 paymaster or to set specific paymaster policies, refer
to the documentation on configuring the bundler through the code.

To configure the bundler, navigate to the `Bundler & Paymaster` tab within the `Smart Accounts`
section. The bundler url must be added for each supported chain.

## Configure Paymaster

Web3Auth allows developers to configure a paymaster of their choice to sponsor gas fees on behalf of
users. To define a paymaster context or set additional parameters, such as selecting the token for
ERC-20 paymasters, specifying gas policies, and more, refer to the documentation on configuring the
paymaster through code.

To configure a paymaster via the dashboard, navigate to the `Bundler & Paymaster` tab under the
`Smart Accounts` section. The paymaster url must be added for each supported chain.

:::info

Currently, the sponsored paymaster can only be configured via the dashboard. For ERC-20 paymaster,
refer to the documentation on configuring the paymaster through code.
