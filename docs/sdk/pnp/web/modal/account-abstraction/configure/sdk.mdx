While the dashboard provides a convenient way to configure Smart Accounts, the SDK offers greater
flexibility by allowing developers to override these settings. It supports advanced configurations
such as specifying an ERC-20 paymaster, defining the paymaster context, and setting additional
parameters like sponsorship policies.

## Override Paymaster Context

The Web3Auth SDK allows developers to override the paymaster context defined in the dashboard for
specified chains. This is particularly useful when the selected paymaster requires a custom
paymaster context with additional settings.

Developers can pass metadata within the paymaster context to provide the information needed to
process UserOperations. This may include the type of paymaster (e.g., Sponsored or ERC-20-based),
token references for gas sponsorship, custom gas policies or limits, and any other parameters
relevant to the sponsorship logic.

:::info

Please note that the paymaster context must be manually configured for each chain that needs to be
supported.

```ts
import { WEB3AUTH_NETWORK, Web3AuthOptions } from "@web3auth/modal";

const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_DEVNET,
  // focus-start
  accountAbstractionConfig: {
    smartAccountType: "metamask",
    chains: [
      {
        chainId: "0x1",
        bundlerConfig: {
          url: "YOUR_BUNDLER_URL",
          // This is just an example of how you can configure the paymaster context.
          // Please refer to the documentation of the paymaster you are using
          // to understand the required parameters.
          paymasterContext: {
            token: "SUPPORTED_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS",
            sponsorshipPolicyId: "sp_my_policy_id",
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  // focus-end
};
```
