For enabling interoperability with Wallet Connect, ie. connecting your W3A generated wallet to other dApps which have Wallet Connect integration, you
can use the `showWalletConnectScanner()` method. This method uses the Wallet Connect `copy and paste` flow, in which you can directly copy the QR Code
details from a dApp like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io) and paste in it your shown modal.

:::info

This uses the [Torus EVM Wallet UI Plugin](/sdk/helper-sdks/plugins/evm-wallet). Please install and configure the package before using this function.
