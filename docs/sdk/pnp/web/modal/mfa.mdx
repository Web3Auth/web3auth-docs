At Web3Auth, we prioritize your security by offering Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). MFA is an
extra layer of protection that verifies your identity when accessing your account. To ensure
ownership, you must provide two or more different backup factors. You have the option to choose from
the device, social, backup factor (seed phrase), and password factors to guarantee access to your
Web3 account. Once you create a recovery factor, MFA is enabled, and your keys are divided into
three shares for off-chain multi-sig, making the key self-custodial. With backup factors, you can
easily recover your account if you lose access to your original device or helps login into a new
device.

For a dApp, we provide various options to set up Multi-Factor Authentication. You can customize the
MFA screen by setting the `mfaLevel` argument. You can enable or disable a backup factor and change
their order. Currently, there are four values for `mfaLevel`:

- `default`: presents the MFA screen every third login
- `optional`: presents the MFA screen on every login, but you can skip it
- `mandatory`: make it mandatory to set up MFA after login
- `none`: skips the MFA setup screen

:::caution Note

If you are using default verifiers, your users may have set up MFA on other dApps that also use
default Web3Auth verifiers. In this case, the MFA screen will continue to appear if the user has
enabled MFA on other dApps. This is because MFA cannot be turned off once it is enabled.

## Installing Auth Adapter

Social logins in Web3Auth are enabled by the [`auth-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth). Natively,
it is already present and preconfigured within the Plug and Play SDK, but for custom configurations,
you need to install the adapter package.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/auth-adapter
```

## Configuring Auth Adapter

While instantiating the Auth Adapter, you can pass some configuration objects to the constructor.
One of these configurations is the `loginSettings` configuration which enables you to make changes
in the adapter, enabling add more settings to your login function using web3auth.

:::tip

Checkout the [`auth-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth) SDK Reference for more details on
different configurations you can pass for customisations.

### Login Settings

#### `loginSettings`

<AuthLoginSettings />

```tsx title="Usage"
import { AuthAdapter } from "@web3auth/auth-adapter";

const authAdapter = new AuthAdapter({
  loginSettings: {
    mfaLevel: "mandatory", // default, optional, mandatory, none
  },
});
```

### Adapter Settings

#### `adapterSettings`

<AuthAdapterSettings />

##### `mfaSettings`

<MFAMinimumPlan />

![Backup MFA Options](/images/mfa-options.gif)

```tsx title="Usage"
import { AuthAdapter } from "@web3auth/auth-adapter";

const authAdapter = new AuthAdapter({
  loginSettings: {
    mfaLevel: "mandatory", // default, optional, mandatory, none
  },
  adapterSettings: {
    // SCALE and above plan only feature
    mfaSettings: {
      deviceShareFactor: {
        enable: true,
        priority: 1,
        mandatory: true, // at least two factors are mandatory
      },
      backUpShareFactor: {
        enable: true,
        priority: 2,
        mandatory: true, // at least two factors are mandatory
      },
      socialBackupFactor: {
        enable: true,
        priority: 3,
        mandatory: false,
      },
      passwordFactor: {
        enable: true,
        priority: 4,
        mandatory: false,
      },
      passkeysFactor: {
        enable: true,
        priority: 5,
        mandatory: false,
      },
      authenticatorFactor: {
        enable: true,
        priority: 6,
        mandatory: false,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

:::note Note

- At least two factors are mandatory when setting up the mfaSettings.
- If you set `mandatory: true` for all factors, the user must set up all four factors.
- If you set `mandatory: false` for all factors, the user can skip setting up MFA. But at least two
  factors are mandatory.
- If you set `mandatory: true` for some factors and `mandatory: false` for others, the user must set
  up the mandatory factors and can skip the optional factors. But, the user must set up at least two
  factors.
- The `priority` field is used to set the order of the factors. The factor with the lowest priority
  will be the first factor to be set up. The factor with the highest priority will be the last
  factor to be set up.
