The Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) feature refers to the ability of the user to create a backup share (recovery phrase). Once a recovery phrase is
created, the user keys are divided into 3 shares enabling the off-chain multisig functionality, making the key further self custodial for the user.
Without an MFA, this is not enabled to make sure the user doesn't lose the keys by accidently clearing their browser local storage. A backup share
helps a user to login into a new device and also to recover their account if they lose their original device.

For a dApp, we give a variety of choices to set the multi factor authentication for the user. You can set the `mfaLevel` argument within the
`loginSettings` of the **Openlogin Adapter** to customize when MFA screen should be shown to user. It currently accepts 4 values:

- **`'default'`** Setting mfa level to `default` will present mfa screen to user on every third login.
- **`'optional'`** Setting mfa level to `optional` will present mfa screen to user on every login but user can skip it.
- **`'mandatory'`** Setting mfa level to `mandatory` will make it mandatory for user to setup mfa after login.
- **`'none'`** Setting mfa level to `none` will make the user skip the mfa setup screen

## Installing Openlogin Adapter

---

Social logins in Web3Auth are enabled by the [`openlogin-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin). Natively, it is already present and preconfigured
within the Plug and Play SDK, but for custom configurations, you need to install the adapter package.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/openlogin-adapter
```

## Configuring Openlogin Adapter

While instantiating the Openlogin Adapter, you can pass some configuration objects to the constructor. One of these configurations is the
`loginSettings` configuration which enables you to make changes in the adapter, enabling add more settings to your login function using web3auth.

:::tip

Checkout the [`openlogin-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin) SDK Reference for more details on different configurations you can pass for
customisations.
