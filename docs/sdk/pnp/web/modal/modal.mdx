This package provides the main class for using the default Web3Auth Modal. The package includes all
of our packages and gives you a simple way of implementing Web3Auth within your interface.
Additionally, it is a child class of [`@web3auth/no-modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) package. Hence,
you can still call all the functions available in the [`@web3auth/no-modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal)
package.
