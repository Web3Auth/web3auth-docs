[Custom Authentication](/features/custom-authentication) is a way to authenticate users with your
custom authentication service. For example, while authenticating with Google, you can use your own
Google Client ID to authenticate users directly.

To enable this, you need to [Create a Verifier](/auth-provider-setup/verifiers) from the **Custom
Authentication** tab of your project from the
[Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) with your desired configuration.

:::warning

For Custom JWT-based authentication services, you need to use the
[`Web3Auth Plug and Play NoModal SDK`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal), since the Web3Auth Modal will only
help you configure the social logins present within the Modal UI.

:::

## Installing Auth Adapter

---

Social logins in Web3Auth are enabled by the [`auth-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth). Natively,
it is already present and preconfigured within the Plug and Play SDK, but for custom configurations,
you need to install the adapter package.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/auth-adapter
```

## Configuring Auth Adapter

While instantiating the Auth Adapter, you can pass some configuration objects to the constructor.
One of these configurations is the `adapterSettings` configuration which enables you to make changes
in the adapter, enabling you to do things like Whitelabeling and Custom Authentication among other
things.

:::tip

Checkout the [`auth-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth) SDK Reference for more details on
different configurations, you can pass for customizations.

:::

Further, the `loginConfig` parameter of the `adapterSettings` configuration helps us to customize
the social logins. Since we're using the `@web3auth/modal`, ie. the Plug and Play Modal SDK, the
`loginConfig` should correspond to the socials mentioned in the modal.

#### `loginConfig`

The `loginConfig` parameter of `adapterSettings` in `AuthAdapter` contains the following properties:

<LoginConfig />

## Example

Since we're using the `@web3auth/modal` ie. the Plug and Play Modal SDK, the `loginConfig` should
correspond to the socials mentioned in the modal.

### Single Verifier

<CustomAuthenticationWeb3AuthExample />

### Aggregate Verifier

```tsx
import AuthAdapter from "@web3auth/auth-adapter";

const authAdapter = new AuthAdapter({
  adapterSettings: {
    // focus-start
    loginConfig: {
      // Google login
      google: {
        verifier: "YOUR_AGGREGATE_VERIFIER_NAME", // Please create an aggregate verifier on the developer dashboard and pass the name here
        verifierSubIdentifier: "YOUR_SUB_VERIFIER_NAME", // Pass in the sub verifier name here
        typeOfLogin: "google", // Pass on the login provider of the verifier you've created
        clientId: "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID", // based on sub verifier, pass in the clientId of the login provider here - Please note this differs from the Web3Auth ClientID.
      },
      github: {
        verifier: "YOUR_AGGREGATE_VERIFIER_NAME", // Please create an aggregate verifier on the developer dashboard and pass the name here
        verifierSubIdentifier: "YOUR_SUB_VERIFIER_NAME", // Pass in the sub verifier name here
        typeOfLogin: "github", // Pass on the login provider of the verifier you've created
        clientId: "YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID", // based on sub verifier, pass in the clientId of the login provider here - Please note this differs from the Web3Auth ClientID.
        jwtParameters: {
          domain: "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN",
          verifierIdField: "YOUR_AUTH0_VERIFIER_ID_FIELD",
          isVerifierIdCaseSensitive: true, // only if the verifier id is case sensitive, else remove this line
        },
      },
    },
    // focus-end
  },
  privateKeyProvider,
});
web3auth.configureAdapter(authAdapter);
```
