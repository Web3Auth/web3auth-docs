In the Plug and Play product, we offer a modular package of Web3Auth which helps you connect the
Social Logins (using Auth Adapter) alongside external wallet via a modular adapter interface. This
helps you make Web3Auth, a one stop solution for all your authentication needs and get started
quickly with your user onboarding journey. An adapter is just an extension/ connector of the
underlying wallet to Web3Auth. This modular approach helps the package remain lightweight and easy
to use, while providing you the flexibilty of using multiple underlying packages in an efficient
way.

For using Web3Auth in the web, you have two choices of SDKs to get started with.

- **Web3Auth Plug and Play Modal SDK [`@web3auth/modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/modal/):** A simple and easy
  to use SDK that will give you a simple modular way of implementing Web3Auth directly within your
  application. You can use the pre-configured Web3Auth Modal UI and whitelabel it according to your
  needs.

- **Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK [`@web3auth/no-modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal):** The core
  module implemeting all the Web3Auth features you need and giving you the flexibilty of using your
  own UI with the Web3Auth SDK working in the backend.

## Web3Auth Plug and Play Modal SDK

### [`@web3auth/modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/modal)

This package provides main class for using default Web3Auth Modal. The package includes all of our
packages and gives you a simple way of implementing Web3Auth within your interface. Additionally, it
is a child class of [`@web3auth/no-modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) package. Hence, you can still call
all the functions available in the [`@web3auth/no-modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) package.

:::tip

Head on to the [`@web3auth/modal` SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/modal) section to get started.

## Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK

### [`@web3auth/no-modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal)

This package provides the core logic for handling adapters within Web3auth. This package acts as a
manager for all the wallet adapters we offer. You should use this package to build your custom login
UI on top of Web3Auth. The SDK size for this is comparatively smaller than the Plug and Play Modal
SDK, since it doesn't have the Web3Auth Modal UI within it.

Head on to the [`web3auth/no-modal` SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) to get started.

## Additional SDKs

### Adapter packages

Adapter acts as a connector between the Web3Auth and an underlying wallet provider. Web3Auth uses
the default [`@web3auth/auth-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth) for social logins. For the rest
of the external wallets, every adapter follows a common interface which is required by Web3Auth to
communicate with the wallet.

:::tip

Checkout the [Adapters SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters) to learn more.

Currently we have the following adapters available for utilisation:

- [`@web3auth/auth-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth) _**- default** (Enables social logins)_
- [`@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/torus-evm)
- [`@web3auth/torus-solana-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/torus-solana)
- [`@web3auth/metamask-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/metamask)
- [`@web3auth/phantom-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/phantom)
- [`@web3auth/wallet-connect-v1-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/wallet-connect-v1)
- [`@web3auth/coinbase-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/coinbase)
- [`@web3auth/solflare-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/solflare)

### wagmi Connector

**wagmi** is a collection of React Hooks containing everything you need to start working with
Ethereum. Web3Auth can be used with wagmi library to ease the integration process for a dApp using
wagmi hooks.

Simply use [`@web3auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector`](/sdk/pnp/web/wagmi-connector) which connects with
both Modal and No Modal SDKs in your dApp to manage the interactions seamlessly.

## Helper SDKs

### Wallet Services

Web3Auth Wallet Services offer modular, pluggable enhancements for your Web3Auth-integrated wallet,
designed to elevate both functionality and user experience within your application. These services
facilitate seamless integration, providing a comprehensive set of features without necessitating
additional UI development. From sophisticated wallet functionality to user engagement tools and
efficient transaction management, Web3Auth Wallet Services are tailored to meet the needs of modern
day dApp experiences.

:::tip

Head on to the [`@web3auth/wallet-services-plugin`](/sdk/pnp/web/wallet-services) to get started.

### Provider packages

For making RPC calls within your dApp, Web3Auth exposes respective providers for different chains.
This provider can be used to interact with the connected chain using exposed functions within the
provider. Currently Web3Auth supports providers for both EVM and Solana chains. For other chains,
one can easily get the private key from the Web3Auth SDK.

:::tip

Checkout the [Providers SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/providers) to learn more.

- [For EVM based Chains `@web3auth/ethereum-provider`](/sdk/pnp/web/providers/evm)
- [For Solana Blockchain `@web3auth/solana-provider`](/sdk/pnp/web/providers/solana)
- [Common Key Provider for other Blockchains `@web3auth/base-provider`](/sdk/pnp/web/providers/common)

### Common Types and Interfaces

#### [`@web3auth/base`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/base)

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by
providing you a standard way of importing the values you need to work with the SDKs. We highly
recommend using it while working with Typescript.
