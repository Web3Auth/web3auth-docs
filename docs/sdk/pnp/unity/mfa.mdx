MFA is an extra layer of protection that verifies your identity when accessing your account. To ensure ownership, you must provide two or more
different backup factors. You have the option to choose from the device, social, backup factor (seed phrase), and password factors to guarantee access
to your Web3 account. Once you create a recovery factor, MFA is enabled, and your keys are divided into three shares for off-chain multi-sig, making
the key self-custodial. With backup factors, you can easily recover your account if you lose access to your original device or help login into a new
device.

For a dApp, we provide various options to set up Multi-Factor Authentication. You can customize the MFA screen by setting the `mfaLevel` argument. You
can enable or disable a backup factor and change their order. Currently, there are four values for `mfaLevel`:

- `default`: presents the MFA screen every third login
- `optional`: presents the MFA screen on every login, but you can skip it
- `mandatory`: make it mandatory to set up MFA after login
- `none`: skips the MFA setup screen

:::caution Note

If you are using default verifiers, your users may have set up MFA on other dApps that also use default Web3Auth verifiers. In this case, the MFA
screen will continue to appear if the user has enabled MFA on other dApps. This is because MFA cannot be turned off once it is enabled.

:::

We offer the following backup factors under `mfaSettings`:

- `deviceShareFactor`,
- `backUpShareFactor`,
- `socialBackupFactor`, and
- `passwordFactor`.

Choose the best options that suit your needs to ensure a safe and secure Web3 experience.
