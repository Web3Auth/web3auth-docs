   ```

   From the `Dependency Rule` dropdown, select `Exact Version` and enter `7.5.0` as the version.

## Configuration

To use Web3Auth you need to provide your Web3Auth `ClientId` to the SDK.

- Go to [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io), and create or open an existing Web3Auth project to copy your Client ID from Project Details.
- Whitelist `(bundleId)://auth` in the developer dashboard. This step is mandatory for the redirect to work.
