import PlistInitialization from "@site/src/common/sdk/pnp/ios/_plist-initialization.mdx";
import Initialization from "@site/src/common/sdk/pnp/ios/_initialize.mdx";

After installation, the next step to use Web3Auth is to initialize the SDK. However, the
initialization can be done in two ways,

- [Creating `Web3Auth.plist`](#creating-web3authplist)
- [Using `Web3Auth` instance](#using-web3auth-instance)

Please note that these are the most critical steps where you need to pass on different parameters
according to the preference of your project. Additionally, Whitelabeling and Custom Authentication
have to be configured within this step, if you wish to customize your Web3Auth Instance.

## Creating `Web3Auth.plist`

### Setup `Web3Auth.plist`

<PlistInitialization />

## Using `Web3Auth` instance

<Initialization />

### `W3AInitParams` object

The `Web3Auth` constructor takes an object called `W3AInitParams` as input. Below are the available
fields of the `W3AInitParams` object.
