The Multi-Factor Authentication feature refers to the ability of the user to create a backup share (recovery phrase). This helps them log into a new
device and also to recover their account if they lose their original device.

:::note Minimum Growth plan required

This is a paid feature and the minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this SDK in a production environment is the
**Growth Plan**. You can use this feature in the development environment for free.

:::

You can set the `mfaLevel` within the `web3auth.login()` to customize when the mfa screen should be shown to the user. It currently accepts 4 values:

- **`default`** - Setting the mfaLevel to default will present the MFA screen to the user on every third login. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.DEFAULT`
- **`optional`** - Setting mfaLevel to optional will present the MFA screen to the user on every login but the user will have the option to skip it.
  `mfaLevel = MFALevel.OPTIONAL`
- **`mandatory`** - Setting mfaLevel to mandatory will make it mandatory for the user to set up MFA after login. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.MANDATORY`
- **`none`** - Setting mfaLevel to none will skip the mfa setup screen totally. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.NONE`

:::caution Note

If you are using default verifiers, your users may have set up MFA on other dApps that also use default Web3Auth verifiers. In this case, the MFA
screen will continue to appear if the user has enabled MFA on other dApps. This is because MFA cannot be turned off once it is enabled.

:::

```tsx
export const MFA_LEVELS = {
  DEFAULT: "default",
  OPTIONAL: "optional",
  MANDATORY: "mandatory",
  NONE: "none",
};
```

## Using the `mfaSettings` to configure the MFA Order

:::note Minimum SCALE plan required

This is a paid feature and the minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this SDK in a production environment is the **SCALE
Plan**. You can use this feature in the development environment for free.

:::

You can configure the order of MFA or enable/disable MFA type by passing the `mfaSettings` object in `OpenLoginOptions`. We offer the following backup
factors under `mfaSettings`:

- `deviceShareFactor`,
- `backUpShareFactor`,
- `socialBackupFactor`, and
- `passwordFactor`.

```tsx
export declare const MFA_FACTOR: {
  readonly DEVICE: "deviceShareFactor";
  readonly BACKUP_SHARE: "backUpShareFactor";
  readonly SOCIAL_BACKUP: "socialBackupFactor";
  readonly PASSWORD: "passwordFactor";
};
export type MFA_FACTOR_TYPE = (typeof MFA_FACTOR)[keyof typeof MFA_FACTOR];
export type MFA_SETTINGS = {
  enable: boolean;
  priority?: number;
  mandatory?: boolean;
};
export type MfaSettings = Partial<Record<MFA_FACTOR_TYPE, MFA_SETTINGS>>;
```

## Example

```tsx
const state = await web3auth.login({
  loginProvider: LoginProvider.GOOGLE,
  redirectUrl: resolvedRedirectUrl,
  // highlight-next-line
  mfaLevel: MFALevel.MANDATORY, // MFALevel.DEFAULT, MFALevel.OPTIONAL, MFALevel.MANDATORY, MFALevel.NONE
  // SCALE and above plan only feature
  mfaSettings: {
    deviceShareFactor: {
      enable: true,
      priority: 1,
      mandatory: true,
    },
    backUpShareFactor: {
      enable: true,
      priority: 2,
      mandatory: true,
    },
    socialBackupFactor: {
      enable: true,
      priority: 3,
      mandatory: true,
    },
    passwordFactor: {
      enable: true,
      priority: 4,
      mandatory: true,
    },
  },
});
```
