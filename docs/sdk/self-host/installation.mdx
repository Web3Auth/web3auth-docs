While installing Web3Auth Self Host, you have two options.

- [Standard Installation](#standard-installation): Get started with all the available tKey SDKs & Modules and configure your application accordingly.
- [Custom Installation](#custom-installation): Pick and choose the tKey SDKs & Modules you want to use for your implementation.

## Standard Installation

---

For the standard installation, we recommend installing the `tkey/default` SDK. This package contains all the needed functionalities of the `tkey` SDK.
You can import all the needed SDKs within one bundle and start working on your Web3Auth Self Host implementation.

### [`@tkey/default`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/default)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/default
```

## Custom Installation

---

For the standard installation, you can pick and choose the SDKs and Modules you want to include. To start off, you need to install the `tkey/core`
SDK. This SDK is needed for setting up the basic functionality, i.e. generating a `tkey`.

### [`@tkey/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/core)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/core
```

### Adding the Service Provider

Service Provider in `tKey` is used for generating a **Share B**, i.e. the private key share managed by a wallet service provider via their
authentication flows. This share in the Web3Auth Plug and Play setup generally refers to the social login aspect, where we associate a private key
share with the user's social login, enabling the seamless login experience.

In the Web3Auth Self Host setup, you have to use the Web3Auth Service Provider (`@tkey/service-provider-torus`), which basically implements Web3Auth's
Social Login feature as a service provider, enabling you to associate the social login of the user as one of the shares.

#### [`@tkey/service-provider-torus`](https://npmjs.com/package/@tkey/service-provider-torus)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/service-provider-torus
```

### Adding the Storage Layer

The storage layer is needed to store and recall the shared metadata information to recover the private key from the generated `tKey`. For this, we use
the `@tkey/storage-layer-torus` SDK, allowing you to get and set the Metadata for the various shares generated.

#### [`@tkey/storage-layer-torus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/storage-layer-torus)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/storage-layer-torus
```

### Webpack 5 Issues

With the latest version of webpack, you might face issues mentioning that certain dependencies are missing. These dependencies need to be polyfilled
in your application. Furthermore, your app needs to be reconfigured to use them while building the app.

Please check out our [dedicated guide](/troubleshooting/webpack-issues) for fixing it.
