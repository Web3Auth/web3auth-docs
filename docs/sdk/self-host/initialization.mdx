After Installation, the next step to use Web3Auth Self Host is to Initialize the SDK.

The Initialization takes a few steps, which basically involve initiating the SDK and setting up the service provider, storage layer and modules.

- [Configuration of Service Provider](#configuring-service-provider) _(recommended for social login shares)_
- [Configuration of Storage Layer](#configuring-storage-layer) _(optional)_
- [Configuration of Modules](#configuring-modules) _(optional)_
- **[Instantiation of tKey](#instantiating-tkey)**
- [Initialization of Service Provider](#initializing-service-provider) _(recommended for social login shares)_
- [Triggering Login using Service Provider](#triggering-login-using-service-provider) _(recommended for social login shares)_
- **[Initialization of tKey](#initializing-tkey)**

Please note that these are the most critical steps where you need to pass on different parameters according to the pcommon of your project.
Additionally, Whitelabeling and Custom Authentication have to be configured within this step, if you wish to customise your Web3Auth Instance.

## Configuring Service Provider

---

Service Provider in `tKey` is used for generating a [**Share B**](./introduction), ie. the private key share managed by a wallet service provider via
their own authentication flows. This share in the Web3Auth Plug and Play setup generally refers to the social login aspect, where we associate a
private key share with the social login of the user, enabling the seemless login experience.

In the Web3Auth Self Host setup, you can use the Web3Auth Service Provider (`@tkey/service-provider-torus`), which is basically implements Web3Auth's
Social Login feature as a service provider, enabling you to associate the social login of the user as one of the shares.

#### [`@tkey/service-provider-torus`](https://npmjs.com/package/@tkey/service-provider-torus)

:::tip

Have a look at the [Service Provider Reference](./service-provider) to know more about the Web3Auth Service Provider and its configuration.

:::

### Example

<ServiceProviderExample />

## Configuring Storage Layer

---

A storage layer is needed to store and recall the metadata information of the shares generated so as to be able to recover the private key from the
tKeys generated. For this we use the `@tkey/storage-layer-torus` SDK, which gives you the ability to get and set the Metadata for the various shares
generated.

#### [`@tkey/storage-layer-torus`](./installation#tkeystorage-layer-torus)

:::tip

Have a look at the [Storage Layer Reference](./storage-layer) to know more about the Web3Auth Storage Layer and its configuration.

### Example

<StorageLayerExample />

## Configuring Modules

<ModulesDescription />

### Example

<ModulesExample />

## Instantiating tKey

---

#### Import the `ThresholdKey` class from `@tkey/core`

```javascript
import ThresholdKey from "@tkey/core";
```

#### Assign the `ThresholdKey` class to a variable

```javascript
const tKey = new ThresholdKey(TKeyArgs);
```

This ThresholdKey constructor takes an object with `TKeyArgs` as input.

### Parameters

<TKeyArgs />

### Example

<TKeyInstanceExample />

## Initializing Service Provider

---

:::note

This step is mandatory if you're using the Web3Auth Service Provider and have instantiated it as [mentioned above](#torus-service-provider). If not,
feel free to ignore this step, but make sure to instantiate your preferred wallet so that while logging in and generating tKey, you can pass over the
private key to the base service provider.

:::

If you're using the Web3Auth Service Provider, you need to initialize it within your constructor function so as to use it while logging your user in
through the social accounts. This is done by calling the `init()` function within the `tKey` instance's `serviceProvider` property.

:::tip

Checkout the [Service Provider Reference](./service-provider#initialization-1) to know more about `init()` and its configuration.

:::

### Example

```js
await (tKey.serviceProvider as TorusServiceProvider).init({ skipSw: false });
```

## Triggering Login using Service Provider

---

Once you have initialised the Web3Auth Service Provider, you're ready to trigger the login process. This is a needed step since this will generate a
private key which will be needed by the tKey to generate it's share. This is done by calling the `triggerLogin()` function within the `tKey`
instance's `serviceProvider` property.

:::tip

Checkout the [Service Provider Reference](./service-provider#triggering-login) to know more about `triggerLogin()` and its configuration.

:::

### Example

<TriggerLoginExample />

## Initializing tKey

---

Once you have triggered the login process, you're ready to initialize the tKey. This will generate you a Threshold Key corresponding to your login
provider.

```ts
tKey.initialize(params?);
```

<TkeyInitParams />

### Example

```js
await tKey.initialize();
```
