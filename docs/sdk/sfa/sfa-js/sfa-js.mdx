Web3Auth's `@web3auth/single-factor-auth` SDK is simple and easy-to-use SDK, which helps you
implement the Web3Auth without redirection in a single key pair flow.

With the Web3Auth Plug and Play Web SDKs you can easily and quickly authenticate users and
reconstruct their private key. Web3Auth Plug and Play Web SDK redirects users to a Web3Auth-hosted
screen (i.e. `https://auth.web3auth.io`). This flow is great for most use cases. Still, sometimes
you may want to customize the authentication flow such that you can have more control over the UI
and UX of the authentication process (i.e. to avoid the redirection). This can be achieved through
our new `@web3auth/single-factor-auth` SDK, where now, you'll be able to use Web3Auth and avoid the
redirection to Auth Service hosted screens.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of JavaScipt
- Supports all major JavaScript Frameworks, Libraries and Bundlers
- React Native
  - React Native Release 0.71 and above (for Bare React Native Workflow)
  - Expo SDK 48 and above (for Expo Managed Workflow)
  - iOS Platform Target Version 14 and above
  - Android Target SDK Version 31 and above
- Node.js
  - One needs to re-initialize the SDK for each new user.

:::note

The minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this SDK in a production
environment is the **Growth Plan** since custom verifier setup is a needed feature for Core Kit
SDKs. You can use this SDK with all features enabled in `sapphire_devnet` for free.

:::info One Key Flow Guide

For an optimal flow that allows users to create an MFA setup if desired, use a combination of
Web3Auth Single Factor Auth JS SDK and Web3Auth No Modal SDK for a one-key flow without redirection.

## Helper SDKs

### Provider packages

To make RPC calls within your dApp, Web3Auth exposes respective providers for different chains. This
provider can be used to interact with the connected chain using exposed functions within the
provider. Currently, Web3Auth supports providers for both EVM and Solana chains. For other chains,
you can easily get the private key from the Web3Auth SDK.

:::tip

Check out the [Providers SDK Reference](/sdk/sfa/sfa-js/providers) to learn more.

- [For EVM based Chains `@web3auth/ethereum-provider`](/sdk/sfa/sfa-js/providers/evm)
- [For Solana Blockchain `@web3auth/solana-provider`](/sdk/sfa/sfa-js/providers/solana)
- [Common Key Provider for other Blockchains `@web3auth/base-provider`](/sdk/sfa/sfa-js/providers/common)

### Common Types and Interfaces

#### [`@web3auth/base`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/base)

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by
providing you with a standard way to import the values you need to work with the SDKs. We highly
recommend using it while working with Typescript.
