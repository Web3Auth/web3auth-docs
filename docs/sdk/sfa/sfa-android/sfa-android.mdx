You can use the Web3Auth
[Single Factor Auth Android SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/single-factor-auth-android) as a
library for your Android app to authenticate users through Web3Auth. The SDK is written in Kotlin
and allows for native use of the One Key flow, which starts with just one share of the key. This
means that users can authenticate without redirection in a single key pair flow.

Using the Web3Auth SFA Android SDK, you can authenticate users and reconstruct their private keys
quickly and easily. Additionally, you can use the Web3Auth Plug and Play Android SDK to redirect
users to a Web3Auth-hosted screen (`https://auth.web3auth.io`), which is suitable for most use
cases. However, if you want more control over the UI and UX of the authentication process, you can
customize the authentication flow to avoid redirection. This is possible with the new Web3Auth SFA
Android SDK, which allows you to use Web3Auth SFA Android and prevent redirection to
Openlogin-hosted screens.

## Requirements

- Android API version `26` or newer.

:::note

The minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this SDK in a production
environment is the **Growth Plan** since custom verifier setup is a needed feature for Core Kit
SDKs. You can use this SDK with all features enabled in `sapphire_devnet` for free.
