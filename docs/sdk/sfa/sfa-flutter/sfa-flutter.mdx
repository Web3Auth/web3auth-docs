You can use the Web3Auth
[Single Factor Auth Flutter SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/single-factor-auth-flutter) as a
library for your Flutter app to authenticate users through Web3Auth. The SDK is written in Dart and
allows for native use of the One Key flow, which starts with just one share of the key. This means
that users can authenticate without redirection in a single key pair flow.

Using the Web3Auth SFA Flutter SDK, you can authenticate users and reconstruct their private keys
quickly and easily. Additionally, you can use the Web3Auth Plug and Play Flutter SDK to redirect
users to a Web3Auth-hosted screen (`https://auth.web3auth.io`), which is suitable for most use
cases. However, if you want more control over the UI and UX of the authentication process, you can
customize the authentication flow to avoid redirection. This is possible with the new Web3Auth SFA
Flutter SDK, which allows you to use Web3Auth SFA Flutter and prevent redirection to
Openlogin-hosted screens.

## Requirements

- Android API version `26` or newer.
- iOS 14+, Xcode 11.4+ / 12.x and Swift 4.x / 5.x

SDKs. You can use this SDK with all features enabled in `sapphire_devnet` for free.
