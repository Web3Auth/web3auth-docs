## Introduction to Custom Authentication

---

To use a custom login mechamism with the Web3Auth Android SDK, for example to login using your own custom JWT issuer like Firebase, You can add the
your confiuration to the `loginConfig` field of the `Web3AuthOptions` object. The `loginConfig` field is a key value map. The key should be one of the
`Web3AuthProvider` in its string form, and the value should be a `LoginConfigItem` struct instance.

To use such custom login mechanism, first configure your own verifier in the Web3Auth Dashboard.

Then, you should specify the details of your verifier in the `LoginConfigItem` struct, the details of this struct are as follows.

| Parameter             | Type         | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| verifier              | String?      | No        | The name of the verifier which you have registered in Web3Auth Dashboard.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| typeOfLogin           | TypeOfLogin? | No        | Type of login of this verifier, this value will affect the login flow that is adapted. For example, if you choose google, a google sign-in flow will be used. If you choose jwt, which you should be providing your own JWT token, no sign-in flow will be presented. |

## `ExtraLoginOptions` for special login methods

---

- To use the `EMAIL_PASSWORDLESS` login, you need to put the email into the `login_hint` field of the `extraLoginOptions`.
- To use the `JWT` login, you need to put the jwt token into the `id_token` field of the `extraLoginOptions`.
