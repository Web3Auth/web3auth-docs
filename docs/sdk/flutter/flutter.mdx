For using Web3Auth in Flutter, Web3Auth provides an [Flutter SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-flutter-sdk), written in Dart. The Web3Auth
Flutter SDK is a client-side library you can use with your Flutter app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. It returns a private key generated in a
non custodial way on successful authentication of the user. This authentication can be achieved by using any of the social logins Web3Auth provides or
using a custom authentication flow of your choice.

Source code of the example can be found in [here](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-flutter-sdk/tree/master/example).

### Requirements

Android API version 21 or newer.

## Installation

---

Add `web3auth_flutter` as a dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  web3auth_flutter: ^1.0.1
```

or

```sh
flutter pub add web3auth_flutter
```

### Android

- Perform the native [Android integration steps](/sdk/android#installation).
- For Android, the `redirectUrl` parameter is **specificable**, and has to be added into the `AndroidManifest.xml`.

### iOS

- Perform the native [iOS integration steps](/sdk/ios#installation).

- For iOS, the `redirectUrl` parameter is **fixed**, which is `\(bundleId)://auth`, and does not need to be added as a iOS Custom URL Scheme.
