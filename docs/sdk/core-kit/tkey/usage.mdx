Once you've installed all packages, instantiated tKey and initialized the service provider instance in your constructor, you can use it to
authenticate your users and generate their tKey shares. Further, you can use a variety of functions exposed by the tKey SDK and its modules to manage
different aspects of your users' authentication needs.

We'll be talking in-depth about the following operations:

- [Logging in the User](#log-in)
- [Getting tKey Details](#get-tkey-details)
- [Reconstructing User's Private Key](#reconstruct-private-key)
- [Generating a new Share](#generate-a-new-share)
- [Deleting a Share](#delete-a-share)
- [Using Modules for Further Operations](#using-modules)
- [Making Blockchain Calls](#making-blockchain-calls)

## Log In

The login with the tKey SDK is a 3-step process.

1. Login using your desired login provider and get their OAuth Id Token
2. Use the OAuth ID Token to connect to the Web3Auth Service Provider to generate the OAuth Key
3. Once the OAuth Key is generated, initialize the tKey Instance

However, before starting this process, you need to set up Custom Authentication on your Web3Auth Dashboard. For this, you need to
[Create a Verifier](/auth-provider-setup/verifiers) within the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) with your desired
configuration.

:::tip

If you want to know more about setting up a verifier and how to use it, please refer to the [Auth Provider Setup Documentation](/auth-provider-setup).

:::

### Login using OAuth

You can choose any OAuth Provider of your choice and login using their standard process. You can check out
[our examples](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-core-kit-examples/) where we have used the most common OAuth providers like Google, Auth0,
Firebase etc. Additionally, you can checkout our documentation around OAuth Provider setup [here](/auth-provider-setup).

:::tip Intrinsic Auth Flow

If you prefer using an intrinsic login method with your OAuth Provider, you can do so by using the `TorusServiceProvider`. You can check out the
[additional reading section](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/intrinsic-flow) for more information. This provider doesn't work in a React Native environment.

:::

### Generating OAuth Key

This setup helps you generate a private key which will be needed by the tKey Instance to generate the OAuth Share. This is done by calling the
`connect()` function within the `tKey` instance's `serviceProvider`.

```tsx
tKeyInstance.serviceProvider.connect(params: LoginParams): Promise<BN>;
```

<SFALoginParams />

#### Usage

```tsx
const OAuthShareKey = await(tKeyInstance.serviceProvider as SfaServiceProvider).connect({
  verifier,
  verifierId,
  idToken,
});
```

### Initializing tKey

#### `tKey.initialize(params?)`

Once you have triggered the login process, you're ready to initialize the tKey. This will generate a Threshold Key corresponding to your login
provider.

#### Parameters

<TkeyInitParams />

### Example

<SFASPConnectExample />

## Get tKey Details

#### `tKey.getKeyDetails()`

The function `getKeyDetails()` returns the details of the keys present generated for the specific user. This includes the public key X & Y of the
user, alongside the shares details and the threshold.

### Sample Key Details Return

<TkeyKeyDetailsReturn />

From here, you can know whether the user key can be reconstructed or not.

- If the `requiredShares` is greater than 0, then the key cannot be reconstructed, because this means that the user has not yet generated enough
  shares to meet the threshold.
- Once the `requiredShares` is 0 or less than that, then the key can be reconstructed, and the user can use the shares to generate the private key and
  make further operations on the tKey and manipulate their keys.

```tsx title="Example"
const { requiredShares } = tKey.getKeyDetails();
if (requiredShares <= 0) {
  console.log("All shares are present, you can reconstruct your private key and do operations on the tKey");
} else {
  console.log("You need to generate more shares to reconstruct your private key");
}
```

## Reconstruct Private Key

#### `tKey.reconstructKey()`

The function `reconstructKey()` reconstructs the private key of the user from the shares generated. This function returns the private key of the user
once the threshold has been met.

```tsx
reconstructKey(_reconstructKeyMiddleware?: boolean): Promise<ReconstructedKeyResult>;

export type ReconstructedKeyResult = {
    privKey: BN;
    seedPhrase?: BN[];
    allKeys?: BN[];
};
```

```tsx title="Example"
const { requiredShares } = tKey.getKeyDetails();
if (requiredShares <= 0) {
  const reconstructedKeyResult = await tKey.reconstructKey();
  const privateKey = reconstructedKeyResult?.privKey.toString("hex"));
  console.log("Private Key: ", privateKey);
}
```

## Generate a New Share

#### `tKey.generateNewShare()`

The function `generateNewShare()` generates a new share on the same threshold set by the user. This function returns the new share generated.

```tsx
generateNewShare(): Promise<GenerateNewShareResult>;

export type GenerateNewShareResult = {
    newShareStores: ShareStoreMap;
    newShareIndex: BN;
};
```

```tsx title="Example"
const shareStore = await tKey.generateNewShare();
await(tKey.modules.webStorage as WebStorageModule).storeDeviceShare(shareStore.newShareStores[1]);
console.log("New Share Stored on the Browser Local Storage: ", shareStore.newShareIndex.toString());
```

## Delete a Share

#### `tKey.deleteShare(shareIndex: BNString)`

The function `deleteShare()` deletes a share from the user's shares. This function returns the updated shareStore after the share has been deleted.

```tsx
deleteShare(shareIndex: BNString): Promise<DeleteShareResult>;

export type DeleteShareResult = {
    newShareStores: ShareStoreMap;
};
```

```tsx title="Example"
const shareStore = await tKey.deleteShare(previousShareIndex);
console.log("Share has been deleted", shareStore);
```

## Using Modules

For making advanced operations on tKey and to manipulate the keys, you can use the modules provided by tKey. As mentioned in the
[initialisation](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/initialize) section, you need to configure the modules beforehand to make it work with tKey. Once that is done,
the instance of the respective module is available within your tKey instance and can be used for further operations.

:::tip

Checkout the [Modules](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules) section where we have listed all the available modules alongside the functions that can be used
within them.

:::

## Making Blockchain Calls

Once you have generated the private key, you can use it to make blockchain calls. The key generated by tKey is of type `secp256k1`, which is
compatible with EVM-based blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, and many others that use the same curve. However, you can also convert this key into
other curves and utilize it. For example, we have a dedicated package for converting this module to the `ed25519` curve for usage in Solana and other
blockchains that use this curve.

In addition to that, we have dedicated provider packages for EVM, Solana and XRPL libraries. You can check out their respective documentation in the
[Providers Section](/sdk/helper-sdks/providers/).

:::tip

You can checkout our [Connect Blockchain](/connect-blockchain) documentation which has a detailed guide on how to connect to major blockchains out
there.
