Web3Auth's [`@web3auth/node-sdk`](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-backend/releases) SDK is a simple and easy-to-use SDK in your Node.js backend
to get the same experience as Web3Auth frontend SDKs.

:::info This SDK gives you semi-custodial keys

The [`@web3auth/node-sdk`](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-backend/releases) SDK gives you the simplest flow for onboarding a user with Web3Auth.
The user just needs to click on the login button, connect to their favorite social account (OAuth) or any passwordless flow, like email passwordless,
biometric authentication etc., and a private key is generated for them. This flow has a 1/1 Key Share setup and the whole key via Web3Auth Auth
Network key shares is provided directly to your app, and reconstructed within it.

This flow is still non-custodial since the nodes in the Web3Auth network have a 5/9 consensus mechanism to generate the key shares. However, one can
claim that this flow is custodial to the OAuth Login provider since this is directly generated using credentials provided by them.

Hence we can call this flow a semi-custodial flow, and encourage users to enable MFA to have a 2/3 Key Share setup, which is fully non-custodial.

#### This Documentation is based on the `3.2.0` SDK Version.

## Requirements

- This is a backend SDK and can be used in any node environment
- Basic knowledge of NodeJS and NPM

:::note

The minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this SDK in a production environment is the **Growth Plan** since custom verifier
