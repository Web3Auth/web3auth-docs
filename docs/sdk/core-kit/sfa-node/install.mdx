## [`@web3auth/node-sdk`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/node-sdk)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/node-sdk
```

## Consider adding `@web3auth/base` to your project

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you
need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with `Typescript`.
