For using Web3Auth in React Native, Web3Auth provides an [React Native SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk), written in
TypeScript. The Web3Auth React Native SDK is a client-side library you can use with your React Native app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. It
returns a private key generated in a non custodial way on successful authentication of the user. This authentication can be achieved by using any of
the social logins Web3Auth provides or using a custom authentication flow of your choice.

Source code of the example can be found in [here](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk/tree/master/example).

### Requirements

- For iOS, only iOS 12+ supported since we requires
  [ASWebAuthenticationSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession).

- For Android, Custom Tab support is required.

## Selecting your Workflow

---

In React Native, you have the choice to use one of the following workflows:

- Bare Workflow: Your React Native app is entirely built on your own machine. You can customize your app with Swift/Kotlin native modules.
- Expo Managed Workflow: Your React Native Expo app is built on your Expo's cloud, so you don't have control over the native modules used in the app.

:::tip

You can read more about different workflows in the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/).

## Installation

---

#### [`web3auth-react-native-sdk`](https://github.com/web3auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/react-native-sdk
```

We will also require a `WebBrowser` implementation to allow our JS-based SDK to interact with the native APIs, and there are different extra
installation steps depending on whether you are using the bare workflow or managed workflow. Please refer to
[Choosing between workflows](#managed-workflow-configuration) to pick the correct implementation.

Before starting, please make sure that you have registered your `redirectUrl` in the [Web3Auth dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/).

## Bare workflow Configuration

---

When using our SDK with a bare workflow React Native app, you have to install a `WebBrowser` implementation made by us.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @toruslabs/react-native-web-browser
```

### Android

- Perform the native [Android integration steps](/sdk/android/).
- For Android, the `redirectUrl` parameter is configurable, and has to be added into the `AndroidManifest.xml`.

### iOS

- Perform the native [iOS integration steps](/sdk/ios).

- You may add the `redirectUrl` to your iOS `Info.plist`, but it is not required.

#### Register the URL scheme you intended to use for redirection

- Android `AndoidManifest.xml` (required)
- iOS `Info.plist` (optional)

:::tip

You may refer to [this example app](https://github.com/torusresearch/openlogin-expo-sdk-bare-demo-2) for more details.

## Managed Workflow Configuration

---

When using our SDK with a Expo-based React Native app (aka managed workflow, you have to install the `expo-web-browser` package as a `WebBrowser`
implementation.)

```shell
expo install expo-web-browser
```

#### Adding URL scheme

To allow the Expo based SDK to work with exported Expo Android apps, you need to add the designated scheme into `app.json`

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "openloginexposdkexampleexpo"
  }
}
```

:::tip

You may refer to [this example app](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk/tree/master/example) for more details.
