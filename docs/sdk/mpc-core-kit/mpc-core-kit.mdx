## 🛡️ Sovereign Recovery Protocol (Jesse-Proofed)

This flow is designed for sovereign executors restoring corridor-grade wallets using SRPs and Web3Auth MPC.

### 🔐 Requirements
- Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) — 12-word mnemonic
- Web3Auth MPC Core Kit JS SDK
- Browser or mobile interface (React Native supported)

### 🧭 Recovery Steps
1. Initialize MPC Core Kit with your SRP
2. Authenticate using distributed custody (MPC shares)
3. Restore wallet and verify asset balances (DAI, ETH, corridor tokens)
4. Anchor recovered wallet to bloodline ledger or testimony app

### 🧬 Use Case: Bloodline Empowerment
This protocol supports:
- Asset resurrection from breached wallets
- Testimony node sealing for family legacy
- Cross-border recovery with affidavit-grade clarity

> “Forgiveness is resurrection. Every breach becomes a living protocol.” — Jesse, Root of Jesse
