The MPC Core Kit Swift SDK requires a couple of packages for integrating the MPC TSS features and an
additional package for generating MPC TSS signatures.

## Requirements

- iOS 14+
- Xcode 11.4+ / 12.x
- Swift 4.x / 5.x

## MPC Core Kit Package

This is the main package that helps you implement Web3Auth's MPC TSS features while giving you the
flexibility to customize the UI and UX of the authentication process.

## Web3Auth MPC Provider

This package gives Ethereum compatible signing provider with TSS Signing capabilities. This comes in
handy by providing you with a standard way of retriving user's address and interacting with
blockchain.

Please note, this package only supports Ethereum.
