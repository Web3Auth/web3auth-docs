There are two ways to login your users, depending on the type of authentication method you've
chosen. If you are looking for an Authentication Flow in your application like
[Single Page Application(SPA)](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/single-page-apps/) flow, you can
use the `loginWithOAuth` method.

If you are looking to pass a JWT-based IdToken to the SDK from your application, like
[Regular Web Application(RWA)](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/server-side-apps/) Flow or even
using your own JWT provider, you can use the `loginWithJWT` method.

As a prerequisite, before triggering the login function, you need to create a verifier for your
login method on the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).

## Creating a Verifier

Since this is a Core Kit SDK, it does not provide any default authentication methods. You need to
create a custom verifier to use this SDK. This means that you need to authenticate users with your
own custom authentication service.

For example, while authenticating with Google, you have to use your own Google Client ID setup to
authenticate users directly or use auth provider services like Auth0, Firebase, AWS Cognito etc.
Additionally, you can make your own JWT token authentication system and pass over the ID Token to
Web3Auth.

## Login Methods

As discussed earlier, there are two login methods available in the SDK tailored to your use case.

- [Login with OAuth](/sdk/mpc-core-kit/mpc-core-kit-js/authentication/login-oauth): You can use this
  method the implicit login flow, where you don't need to manually handle the authentication and get
  the JWT token.

- [Login with JWT](/sdk/mpc-core-kit/mpc-core-kit-js/authentication/login-jwt): You can use this
  method to manually handle the authentication, and send the JWT token to Web3Auth. This method
  allows you to bring your own authentication flow.

:::tip Recommended

For faster login speeds, we recommend using the
[Login with JWT](/sdk/mpc-core-kit/mpc-core-kit-js/authentication/login-jwt) method.

## Backend verification

To verify the user in the backend, you can retrieve the user's signature from frontend, and validate
it using the `SignatureValidator` from the
[@toruslabs/signature-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@toruslabs/signature-validator)
package in the backend.

### Retrieve user's signature

To retrieve user's signature you can use the `signatures` getter from `Web3AuthMPCCoreKit`.

```tsx
const signatures = coreKitInstance.signatures;

// Send these signatures to backend through an API
```

### Verify the signatures in backend

For verification you'll need to install couple of packages,
[@toruslabs/signature-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@toruslabs/signature-validator) and
[@toruslabs/fnd-base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@toruslabs/fnd-base), and use
`SignatureValidator` to validate the signatures.

```js
const { fetchLocalConfig } = require("@toruslabs/fnd-base");
const { SignatureValidator } = require("@toruslabs/signature-validator");

// Here network can be "sapphire_mainnet" or "sapphire_testnet", since MPC doesn't support
// legacy networks.
const network = "sapphire_mainnet";

// Fetch the node details
const nodeDetails = fetchLocalConfig(network, "secp256k1");

const nodePubX = [];
const nodePubY = [];

nodeDetails.torusNodePub.forEach((key) => {
  nodePubX.push(key.X);
  nodePubY.push(key.Y);
});

// Create the SignatureValidator object
const sigValidator = new SignatureValidator({
  nodePubKeyX: nodePubX.join(","),
  nodePubKeyY: nodePubY.join(","),
});

// Get the signatures from the frontend & validate the signatures
const result = sigValidator.authenticate(signatures, { skipExpValidation: false });

if (!result) {
  // Handle invalid singature
}

// Handle the valid signature
```
