import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

Once you've installed and successfully initialized `Web3AuthMPCCoreKit`, you can use it to
authenticate your users, add factors to their account, generate TSS signatures for transactions and
interact with the blockchain.

Please, note we for the simplicity, we use the `coreKitInstance` to refer to the instance of
`Web3AuthMPCCoreKit`.

## Authentication Methods

### Login with OAuth

This method helps to Log in the user using OAuth flow. You can choose your preferred social auth
providers with 0Auth login flow. Please refer to the
[authentication section](/sdk/mpc-core-kit/mpc-core-kit-js/authentication/login-oauth) section for
more details.

### Handle Redirect Result

This method helps you hanlde the redirect result form the OAuth Flow when the ux mode is redirect.
By default, you won't require to use this method since we handle the redirect result internally. You
can set the `handleRedirectResult` to false during initialization, and use this method to handle the
redirect result.

### Login With JWT

Logs in the user with a JWT-based ID Token. We recommend using this method to authenticate users for
better performance. For this method, you'll have to manage the authentication yourself, and Web3Auth
will only verify the idToken passed. Please refer to the
[authentication section](/sdk/mpc-core-kit/mpc-core-kit-js/authentication/login-jwt) for more
details.

### Login With Existing Factor

This method can be used to input the factor key, for instance when threshold is not satisfied. For
example, if user's device factor is not present, this method can be used to input the back up factor
key, and recover the account. If the factor key is correct, the SDK initializes the user's account
and logs them in.

If you want to change the factor key in the current state of the SDK, you can use this method.
Please make sure to convert your factor key to BN before passing it to this method.

```tsx
import { BN } from "bn.js";

const factorKey = new BN("backupFactorKey", "hex");
await coreKitInstance.inputFactorKey(factorKey);
```

### Logout

This method logs out the user, and invalidates the session.

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.logout();
```

## Manual Sync Method

### Commit Changes

This method helps you syncs the local metadata with the Web3Auth's Metadata server. This function is
only to be used while in manual sync mode. We recommend using the Manual Sync Mode to handle the
factors and keys of the user's account. This enables you to have a fined grained control over the
API calls made to the metadata server from the SDK.

This is especially useful when you want to handle the factors and keys of the user's account in a
more controlled manner, enabling a much faster and safer experience for the User.

During manual sync mode, you need to call the `commitChanges` function to sync the local metadata to
the web3auth metadata server. This helps you to keep the user's account in sync with the metadata
server, after they have successfully configured everything in the local.

#### Usage

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.commitChanges();
```

## Factor Handling Methods

### Enable MFA

By default, the SDK starts with 2/2 flow unless the `disableHashedFactorKey` is set to true during
initialisation. To make the flow completely non-custodial, and have 2/3 flow, you can use the
enableMFA method.

It creates a device factor and stores it in the local storage. It also creates a backup factor and
returns it to the user. The default backup factor is 24 words mnemonic. You can configure the backup
factor to be social recovery, password recovery, authenticator app, or back up of your choice.

Most importantly, this method also deletes the Hashed Factor Key enabling a non-custodial flow. The
method takes in `enableMFAParams` which allows you to configure the backup factor of your choice.
You can also opt to not create a backup factor by setting `recoveryFactor` to `false`.

#### Function Parameters

| Parameter Name     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enableMFAParams?` | This parameter helps to configure the back up factor of your choice like social recovery, security question, authenticator or more. By default, it'll generate a 24 words mnemonic, and use it as back up factor. Please checkout the [EnableMFAParams](#enablemfaparams) section for more details. |
| `recoveryFactor`   | This helps you disable the backup factor generation during enableMFA flow. If set to false, the enableMFA will on generate a device factor, and flow would be 2/2 instead 2/3. By default, the value is true.                                                                                       |

#### Usage

In this sample we enable MFA with a 24 words mnemonic as the backup factor, and device factor.

```tsx
import { keyToMnemonic } from "@web3auth/mpc-core-kit";

// focus-next-line
const factorKey = await coreKitInstance.enableMFA({});
// Convert the factor key to 24 words mneonic
const factorKeyMnemonic = keyToMnemonic(factorKey);

console.log(
  "MFA enabled, device factor stored in local store, deleted hashed cloud key, your backup factor key: ",
  factorKeyMnemonic,
);
```

### Create Factor

To create a factor, you can use the `createFactor` method. This is a low-level function to help you
to create a backup factor key based on the type of TSS Share you want to create. You can pass your
own factor key or let the SDK generate one for you.

This method helps you add additional factor to the user's account such as device factor, social
recovery, SMS OTP, authenticator, and more.

:::danger Note

You shouldn't create too many factors, we recommend a **maximum of 10 factors**.

:::

#### Parameters

The method takes in `CreateFactorParams` which helps you configure the type of share to be created.

#### Usage

In this sample we create a new factor of type recovery using random factor key generated by the SDK.
You can also pass your own factor key obtained from other sources like social recovery,
authenticator app, etc.

```tsx
import { generateFactorKey } from "@web3auth/mpc-core-kit";

const factorKey = generateFactorKey();

await coreKitInstance.createFactor({
  shareType: TssShareType.RECOVERY,
  factorKey: factorKey.private,
});
```

### Delete Factor

To delete a factor you can use the `deleteFactor` method. This method helps you delete the factor,
respective to the factor pub provided for the user's account.

You can get the factor pubs by using the `getKeyDetails` method. It will throw an error if you try
to delete the factor that is currently active within the state of the SDK.

Use the `inputFactorKey` method to change the factor key in the current state of the SDK before
deleting the current active factor.

#### Usage

In this sample we delete the social recovery factor from the user's account. To delete the device
factor you can replace the `FactorKeyTypeShareDescription.SocialShare` with
`FactorKeyTypeShareDescription.DeviceShare`.

```tsx
import { FactorKeyTypeShareDescription } from "@web3auth/mpc-core-kit";
import { Point, secp256k1 } from "@tkey/common-types";

let factorPub: string | undefined;
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(coreKitInstance.getKeyDetails().shareDescriptions)) {
  if (value.length > 0) {
    const parsedData = JSON.parse(value[0]);
    if (parsedData.module === FactorKeyTypeShareDescription.SocialShare) {
      factorPub = key;
    }
  }
}

if (factorPub) {
  const pub = Point.fromSEC1(secp256k1, factorPub);
  // focus-next-line
  await coreKitInstance.deleteFactor(pub);
  // This is required to sync the changes to the metadata server.
  await coreKitInstance.commitChanges();
} else {
  console.log("No social factor found to delete");
}
```

### Get Current Factor Key

To retrieve the currently active factor within the state of the SDK you can use the
`getCurrentFactorKey` method.

```tsx
const currentFactorKey = coreKitInstance.getCurrentFactorKey();
```

### Get Device Factor

This methods returns the device factor key hex string if available.

```tsx
// focus-next-line
const deviceFactorHex = await coreKitInstance.getDeviceFactor();

if (deviceFactorHex) {
  console.log("Device factor key hex string: ", deviceFactorHex);
} else {
  console.log("No device factor key found");
}
```

## User & Wallet Account Functions

### Set TSS Wallet Index

To set the TSS Wallet index, you can use the `setTssWalletIndex` method.It allows you to set the TSS
wallet index for secp256k1 curve. For secpk256k1 curve, we do support HD Wallet, and you can change
the index for HD Wallet using this method. Learn more about
[HD Wallet](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/keys/hd-wallets/).

As an application, you need to persist this account index in the application state.

You can either choose to persist the account index temporarily using the state variable or use a
more permanent storage like `localStorage`. Whenever you add, delete or update a share, you need to
set the account index again.

:::info

This method is only supported for Secp256k1 curve, and not supported for Ed25519 curve.

:::

```tsx
coreKitInstance.setTssWalletIndex(index);
```

### Get Secp256k1 Public Key

To retrieve the Secp256k1 public key, you can use the `getPubKey` method. You can use this public
key to derive the EOA address.

When you use the `setTssWalletIndex` method to set your account index, a unique public key is
generated! Remember that each account index you set will result in a different public key.

```ts
const pubKey = coreKitInstance.getPubKey();
```

### Get Ed25519 Public Key

To retrive the ed25519 public key, you can use the `getPubKeyEd25519`method. You can use this public
key to retrive the EOA address for the chains suporting the Ed25519 curve.

```ts
const pubKey = coreKitInstance.getPubKeyEd25519();
```

### Get User Info

To retrive the user's information you can use the `getUserInfo` method. The methods returns the
user's information based on the idToken, and Web3Auth metadata like verifier, verifier Id.

```tsx
import { UserInfo } from "@web3auth/mpc-core-kit";
const userInfo: UserInfo = coreKitInstance.getUserInfo();
```

### Get Key Details

To retieve the MPCKeyDetails for the user account you can use the `getKeyDetails` methods. These key
details has information like total factors, required factors, and threshold. Learn more about the
[MPCKeyDetails](#mpckeydetails).

#### Usage

```tsx
import { MPCKeyDetails } from "@web3auth/mpc-core-kit";

const keyDetails: MPCKeyDetails = coreKitInstance.getKeyDetails();
```

can only use this method, once user has completed the authentication flow.

```tsx
import { TssSecurityQuestion } from "@web3auth/mpc-core-kit";

const securityQuestion: TssSecurityQuestion = new TssSecurityQuestion();

const question = securityQuestion.getQuestion(coreKitInstance);
```

### Mnemonic to Key

To convert 24 word mnemonic(seed phrase) into corresponding factor key, you can use the
`mnemonicToKey` method. This is helpful when you want to convert the 24 words mnemonic backup factor
to factor key.

```tsx
import { mnemonicToKey } from "@web3auth/mpc-core-kit";

const factorKeyHex = mnemonicToKey(factorKeyMnemonic);
```

### Key to Mnemonic

To convert the factor key hex string to a 24 words mnemonic, you can use the `keyToMnemonic` method.

```tsx
import { keyToMnemonic } from "@web3auth/mpc-core-kit";

const factorKeyMnemonic = keyToMnemonic(factorKeyHex);
```
