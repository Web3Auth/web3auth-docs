To authenticate users using Single Page Application(SPA) flow, you can use the `loginWithOAuth`
method. This methods takes the `OAuthLoginParams` as a parameter, which is an object that contains
the details of the verifier, and additional authentication parameters.

:::tip React Native

While using the application in React Native, you can use the `ux_mode` as `react-native`, this helps
you to use the SDK in a React Native environment. However, the implicit login flow doesn't work in
React Native, you need to manually call the login with JWT function for it after getting the JWT
token from the auth provider.

:::

## Parameters

The OAuthLoginParams can be either a `SubVerifierDetailsParams` or an
`AggregateVerifierLoginParams`. If you wish to use a aggereate verifier, you can use the
`AggregateVerifierLoginParams`, and for single verifier, you can use the `SubVerifierDetailsParams`.

An aggregate verifier helps to generate a same account across multiple verifiers based on the JWT
verification field. For instance if you are using Google, and Email Passwordless, and want to
genetate the same account across both authentication method, you need to use an aggregate verifier.

### SubVerifierDetailsParams

Contains the details of the verifier the app needs to use for authentication. You need to use this
in the case of a single verifier.

## Usage

### Single Verifier

To login with a single verifier, you will require to create a custom verifier in the Web3Auth
dashboard. If you haven't already created one,
[learn how to create a verifier](/docs/auth-provider-setup/verifiers).

```tsx
import { SubVerifierDetailsParams } from "@web3auth/mpc-core-kit";

const verifierConfig: SubVerifierDetailsParams = {
  subVerifierDetails: {
    typeOfLogin: "google",
    verifier: "w3a-google-demo",
    clientId: "519228911939-cri01h55lsjbsia1k7ll6qpalrus75ps.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  },
};

await coreKitInstance.loginWithOAuth(verifierConfig);
```

### Aggregate Verifier

To login with an aggregate verifier, you will require to create an aggregate verifier in the
Web3Auth dashboard. If you haven't already created one,
[learn how to create an aggregate verifier](/docs/auth-provider-setup/aggregate-verifier#set-up-an-aggregate-verifier).

```tsx
import { AggregateVerifierLoginParams } from "@web3auth/mpc-core-kit";

const verifierConfig: AggregateVerifierLoginParams = {
  aggregateVerifierIdentifier: "aggregate-sapphire",
  subVerifierDetailsArray: [
    {
      typeOfLogin: "google",
      verifier: "w3a-google",
      clientId: "774338308167-q463s7kpvja16l4l0kko3nb925ikds2p.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    },
  ],
};

await coreKitInstance.loginWithOAuth(verifierConfig);
```

## Importing an existing account.

During the first-time login with `Web3AuthMPCCoreKit`, you can import an existing account using the
`importTssKey` parameter. To import a secp256k1 chain account, be sure to provide the private key in
hex format. For an ed25519 chain account, you need to pass the seed.

By default, the ed25519 key is formatted in base58 and is 64 bytes long. This consists of the first
32 bytes as the seed (also known as the private key) and the last 32 bytes as the public key. Ensure
that the first 32 bytes are provided in hexadecimal format when using the ed25519 seed.

```tsx
import { SubVerifierDetailsParams } from "@web3auth/mpc-core-kit";

const verifierConfig: SubVerifierDetailsParams = {
  subVerifierDetails: {
    typeOfLogin: "google",
    verifier: "w3a-google-demo",
    clientId: "519228911939-cri01h55lsjbsia1k7ll6qpalrus75ps.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  },
  // focus-next-line
  importTssKey: "SECP256K1_PRIVATE_KEY_OR_ED25519_SEED",
};

await coreKitInstance.loginWithOAuth(verifierConfig);
```

## Popup Mode

If you're using the popup mode (default) in your application, while logging in, you need to have a
service worker running, which essentially catches the login redirect and sends it back to the main
DOM with the parameters. These parameters are then used to log in the user with Web3Auth.

### Service Worker

A service worker is a script that is run by the browser. It does not have any direct relationship
with the DOM and provides many out-of-the-box network-related features. Web3Auth Core Kit tKey SDK
needs a service worker relative to `baseUrl` to capture the auth redirect at `redirectPathName`
path.

For example, while using service worker if `baseUrl` is `https://your-domain.com/serviceworker` then
the user will be redirected to the `https://your-domain.com/serviceworker/redirect` page after
logging in where the service worker will capture the results and send it back to the original window
where login was initiated.

:::tip

- Using a service worker is required only in the popup flow.

- A service worker is needed if you are using `popup` uxMode within your MPC Core Kit Configuration.

- For browsers where service workers are not supported, or in the case you wish to not use service
  workers, create and serve redirect page (i.e. `redirect.html` file).

:::

### Service Worker Setup

- If you're using React, to set up service worker, you need to create a `sw.js` file in your public
  folder and register it in your `index.html` file. You can find more information about it in
  [this blog](https://blog.bitsrc.io/using-service-workers-with-react-27a4c5e2d1a9).

- For Angular, [this guide](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-getting-started) will be helpful
  in setting up the service worker.

- For Vue,
  [this guide](https://www.360learntocode.com/2020/12/how-to-use-and-customize-service-worker-in-vuejs-pwa.html)
  is a great way to get started with service workers.

### Service Worker Code

You can directly copy the service worker file code from here and paste it into your respective
folder. You can also find the code in our
[MPC Core Kit Example (Popup Flow)](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-core-kit-examples/tree/main/mpc-core-kit-web/implicit-flow-examples/mpc-core-kit-popup-flow-example).

  <ServiceWorkerCode />
</details>

## Redirect Mode

If you are using the redirect mode, you don't have to use the service worker or `redirect.html`
file. You can get login results by calling the `init()` function on the redirected page mount.

For example, if `baseUrl` is `https://your-domain.com` and `redirectPathName` is `auth` then the
user will be redirected to the `https://your-domain.com/auth` page after logging in where you can
get login result by calling `init()` function on redirected page mount.
