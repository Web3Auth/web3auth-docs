Once you've installed all packages, and instantiated tKey instance in your constructor, you can use
it to authenticate your users and generate their tKey shares. Further, you can use a variety of
functions exposed by the tKey SDK and its modules to manage different aspects of your users'
authentication needs.

We'll be talking in-depth about the following operations:

- [Logging in the User](#log-in)
- [Getting tKey Details](#get-tkey-details)
- [Reconstructing User's Private Key](#reconstruct-private-key)
- [Generating a new Share](#generate-a-new-share)
- [Deleting a Share](#delete-a-share)
- [Using Modules for Further Operations](#using-modules)
- [Making Blockchain Calls](#making-blockchain-calls)

## Log In

The login with the tKey SDK is a 3-step process.

1. Login using your desired login provider and get their OAuth Id Token
2. Use the OAuth ID Token to connect to the Web3Auth Service Provider to generate the OAuth Key
3. Once the OAuth Key is generated, initialize the tKey Instance

However, before starting this process, you need to set up Custom Authentication on your Web3Auth
Dashboard. For this, you need to [Create a Verifier](/auth-provider-setup/verifiers) within the
[Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) with your desired configuration.

:::tip

If you want to know more about setting up a verifier and how to use it, please refer to the
[Auth Provider Setup Documentation](/auth-provider-setup).

:::

### Login using OAuth

You can choose any OAuth Provider of your choice and login using their standard process. You can
check out [our examples](https://github.com/tkey/tkey-examples/web) where we have used the most
common OAuth providers like Google, Auth0, Firebase etc. Additionally, you can checkout our
documentation around OAuth Provider setup [here](/auth-provider-setup).

:::tip Implicit Auth Flow

If you prefer using an implicit login method with your OAuth Provider, you can do so by using the
`TorusServiceProvider`. You can check out the
[additional reading section](/sdk/infra/tkey/implicit-flow) for more information. This provider
doesn't work in a React Native environment.

:::

### Generating OAuth Key

This setup helps you generate a private key which will be needed by the tKey Instance to generate
the OAuth Share. This is done by calling the `connect()` function within the `tKey` instance's
`serviceProvider`.

```tsx
tKeyInstance.serviceProvider.connect(params: LoginParams): Promise<BN>;
```

<SFALoginParams />

#### Usage

```tsx
const OAuthShareKey = await(tKeyInstance.serviceProvider as SfaServiceProvider).connect({
  verifier,
  verifierId,
  idToken,
});
```

### Initializing tKey

#### `initialize(params?: TKeyInitArgs)`

Once you have triggered the login process, you're ready to initialize the tKey. This will generate a
Threshold Key corresponding to your login provider.

#### Parameters

<TkeyInitParams />

### Example

<SFASPConnectExample />

## Get tKey Details

#### `tKey.getKeyDetails()`

The function `getKeyDetails()` returns the details of the keys generated for the specific user. This
includes the public key X & Y of the user, alongside the shares details and the threshold.

### Sample Key Details Return

<TkeyKeyDetailsReturn />

From here, you can know whether the user key can be reconstructed or not.

- If the `requiredShares` is greater than 0, then the key cannot be reconstructed, because this
  means that the user has not yet generated enough shares to meet the threshold.
- Once the `requiredShares` is 0 or less than that, then the key can be reconstructed, and the user
  can use the shares to generate the private key and make further operations on the tKey and
  manipulate their keys.

```tsx title="Example"
const { requiredShares } = tKey.getKeyDetails();
if (requiredShares <= 0) {
  console.log(
    "All shares are present, you can reconstruct your private key and do operations on the tKey",
  );
} else {
  console.log("You need to generate more shares to reconstruct your private key");
}
```

## Reconstruct Private Key

#### `tKey.reconstructKey()`

The function `reconstructKey()` reconstructs the private key of the user from the shares generated.
This function returns the private key of the user once the threshold has been met.

```tsx
reconstructKey(_reconstructKeyMiddleware?: boolean): Promise<ReconstructedKeyResult>;

export type ReconstructedKeyResult = {
    secp256k1Key: BN;
    ed25519Seed?: Buffer;
    seedPhrase?: BN[];
    allKeys?: BN[];
};;
```

```tsx title="Example"
const { requiredShares } = tKey.getKeyDetails();

if (requiredShares <= 0) {
  const reconstructedKeyResult = await tKey.reconstructKey();
  const privateKey = reconstructedKeyResult?.secp256k1Key.toString("hex");
  console.log("Private Key: ", privateKey);
}
```

## Generate a New Share

#### `tKey.generateNewShare()`

The function `generateNewShare()` generates a new share on the same threshold set by the user. This
function returns the new share generated.

```tsx
generateNewShare(): Promise<GenerateNewShareResult>;

export type GenerateNewShareResult = {
    newShareStores: ShareStoreMap;
    newShareIndex: BN;
};
```

```tsx title="Example"
const generateShareResult = await tKey.generateNewShare();
const share = await tKey.outputShareStore(generateShareResult.newShareIndex);

await(tKey.modules.webStorage as WebStorageModule).storeDeviceShare(share);
console.log("New Share Stored on the Browser Local Storage: ", share);
```

## Delete a Share

#### `tKey.deleteShare(shareIndex: BNString)`

The function `deleteShare()` deletes the user's given share. This function returns the updated
shareStore after the share has been deleted.

```tsx
deleteShare(shareIndex: BNString): Promise<DeleteShareResult>;

export type DeleteShareResult = {
    newShareStores: ShareStoreMap;
};
```

```tsx title="Example"
const shareStore = await tKey.deleteShare(previousShareIndex);
console.log("Share has been deleted", shareStore);
```

## Using Modules

For making advanced operations on tKey and to manipulate the keys, you can use the modules provided
by tKey. As mentioned in the [initialisation](/sdk/infra/tkey/initialize) section, you need to
configure the modules beforehand to make it work with tKey. Once that is done, the instance of the
respective module is available within your tKey instance and can be used for further operations.

:::tip

Checkout the [Modules](/sdk/infra/tkey/modules) section where we have listed all the available
modules alongside the functions that can be used within them.

:::

## Making Blockchain Calls

Once you have generated the private key, you can use it to make blockchain calls. The key generated
by tKey is of type `secp256k1`, which is compatible with EVM-based blockchains like Ethereum,
Polygon, and many others that use the same curve. From v13, tKey also generates a `ed25519` key
which is compatible with blockchains like Solana, Aptos, and etc. However, you can also convert
`secp256k1` key into other curves and utilize it.

In addition to that, we have dedicated provider packages for EVM, Solana and XRPL libraries. You can
check out their respective documentation in the [Providers Section](/sdk/pnp/web/providers/).

:::tip

You can checkout our [Connect Blockchain](/connect-blockchain) documentation which has a detailed
guide on how to connect to major blockchains out there.
