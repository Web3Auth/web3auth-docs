The tKey SDK contains multiple packages are needed to enable different functionalities of the tKey
SDK. You can choose the packages you want to install according to the functionalities you want to
enable in your application. In this doc we have highlighted all of the packages and their
functionalities.

## Base tKey Package

While installing Web3Auth Core Kit tKey SDK, we recommend installing the `tkey/core` SDK. This
package contains all the needed core functionalities of the `tkey` SDK.

#### [`@tkey/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/core)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/core
```

## Adding Service Provider

The Service Provider helps with the authentication and identification of the user using their social
logins and giving the user an easy way of account retrieval. We have made a custom service provider
utilizing the [Single Factor Auth JS SDK](/sdk/sfa/sfa-js/) as a service provider within the tKey
SDK.

#### [`@tkey/service-provider-sfa`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/service-provider-sfa)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/service-provider-sfa
```

## Adding Storage Layer

The Storage Layer refers to the Metadata Storage, which is used to store the metadata information of
the shares generated by the tKey SDK.

#### [`@tkey/storage-layer-torus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/storage-layer-torus)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/storage-layer-torus
```

# Modules

Modules extend the tKey SDK's capability to provide additional functionality for managing your tKey
shares. Out of the multiple modules available, you can choose the module you want to include in your
implementation. Here is the list of available modules:

## Storage Modules (Share B)

Storage Modules are used to store the tKey shares in the user's device storage. You can choose any
of the following modules:

### Web Storage Module

Adds the capability to add or remove a share from the local and file storage.

#### [`@tkey/web-storage`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/web-storage)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/web-storage
```

### React Native Storage Module

Adds the capability to add or remove a share from the React Native Encrypted Store/ Expo Secure
Store.

#### [`@tkey/react-native-storage`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/react-native-storage)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/react-native-storage
```

### Chrome Storage Module

Adds the capability to add or remove a share from the Chrome Extension storage.

#### [`@tkey/chrome-storage`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/chrome-storage)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/chrome-storage
```

## Recovery Modules (Share C)

Recovery Modules are used to recover the tKey shares in the case user doesn't have access to their
device/storage or needs additional security.

### Security Questions Module

Adds the capability to add or remove a question and password as a share.

#### [`@tkey/security-questions`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/security-questions)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/security-questions
```

### Share Transfer Module

Adds the capability to transfer a share to another device.

#### [`@tkey/share-transfer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/share-transfer)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/share-transfer
```

### Share Serialization Module

Adds the capability to serialize/ deserialize a BN (private key) into a mnemonic.

#### [`@tkey/share-serialization`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/share-serialization)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/share-serialization
```

## Additional Modules

These modules provide extra capability to the tKey SDK, like importing users' existing private keys
or seedphrases.

### Seed Phrase Module

Adds the capability to store and use seed phrases on the metadata.

#### [`@tkey/seed-phrase`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/seed-phrase)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/seed-phrase
```

### Private Keys Module

Adds the capability to store extra private keys on the metadata.

#### [`@tkey/private-keys`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/private-keys)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/private-keys
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bundler Issues: Missing Dependencies

You might face issues mentioning that certain dependencies are missing within the browser or React
Native environments. These are node dependencies that need to be polyfilled in your application, to
enable Web3Auth functionalities. Furthermore, your bundler needs to be reconfigured to use them
while building the app. We have created guides for different bundlers to help you with this issue:
