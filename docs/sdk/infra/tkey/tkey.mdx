:::note

The minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this SDK in a production
environment is the **Enterprise Plan**. However, you can use this SDK with all features enabled in
`sapphire_devnet` for free.

:::

:::caution

Although you can create as many shares as you want, we recommend you create no more than a total of
6 shares, including your device shares and recovery shares. This is because the more shares you
create, it increases the size of the tKey state, which can cause performance issues in the frontend
and can slow down the login process. Ideally, you should create 2 recovery shares and ask the user
for their trusted devices and only store the device share on them.

## Requirements

### Web

- This is a frontend SDK and can only run in a browser environment
- Basic knowledge of JavaScipt
- Supports all major JavaScript Frameworks, Libraries and Bundlers

### React Native

- React Native Release 0.71 and above (for Bare React Native Workflow)
- Expo SDK 48 and above (for Expo Managed Workflow)
- iOS Platform Target Version 14 and above
- Android Target SDK Version 31 and above

<ExpoWarning />

## Understanding the tKey Flow

The tKey SDK depends upon the Service Provider, Storage Layer and Modules to work as an off chain
multi sig infrastructure working within your app.

### Service Provider

The **Service Provider** helps with the authentication and identification of the user using their
social logins and giving the an easy way of account retreival.

### Storage Layer

The **Storage Layer** refers to the Metadata Storage, which is used to store the metadata
information of the shares generated by the tKey SDK.

### Modules

[**Modules**](/sdk/infra/tkey/modules) are the various functionalities that can be added to the tKey
SDK, tkey enhance the storage and usage of different shares generated in a way it is most suitable
for your project.

We have 3 types of modules available right now:

- [**Storage Modules**](/sdk/infra/tkey/modules/#storage-modules-share-b): Storage Modules are used
  to store the tKey shares in the user's device storage.
- [**Recovery Modules**](/sdk/infra/tkey/modules/#recovery-modules-share-c): Recovery Modules are
  used to recover the tKey shares in the case user doesn't have access to their device/storage or
  needs additional security.
- [**Additional Modules**](/sdk/infra/tkey/modules/#additional-modules): These modules provide extra
  capability to the tKey SDK, like importing user's existing private keys or seedphrases.

### Threshold

The threshold is the minimum number of shares required to reconstruct the private key. By default,
the number is set to `2` which means that at least two shares are required to reconstruct the
private key. This is done to ensure that the private key is not compromised even if one of the
shares is compromised.

### tKey Modes

Apart from this, the tKey SDK internally has multiple modes of operation, which are as follows:

#### Read mode

This happens when atleast 1 share is available to the tKey SDK. In this mode, the tKey SDK can only
read the metadata information of the share currently available to it, alongside the public data of
the other shares.

#### Write mode

This happens when 2 or more shares are available to the tKey SDK. Please note that the threshold set
by the dApp might change this number required. Basically once the key threshold is reached, the tKey
SDK can write the metadata information of the shares and modify them according to the need of the
user.

  applications and try the SDK yourself.

- [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting): Find quick solutions to common issues faced by developers.

- [Source Code](https://github.com/tkey/tkey/): Web3Auth is open sourced. You can find the source
  code on our GitHub repository.

  our team and other developers.

## Helper SDKs

### Provider packages

For making RPC calls within your dApp, Web3Auth exposes respective providers for different chains.
This provider can be used to interact with the connected chain using exposed functions within the
provider. Currently Web3Auth supports providers for both EVM and Solana chains. For other chains,
one can easily get the private key from the Web3Auth SDK.
