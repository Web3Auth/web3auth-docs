Modules extend the tKey SDK's capability to provide additional functionality for managing your tKey
shares. These modules can be used for multiple purposes, from storing shares to generating password
or converting them into a form that can remembered or sent out.

A standard tKey flow looks something like this:

<img
  style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "600px", margin: "20px auto" }}
  src={Image1}
  alt="Web3Auth's Private Key - Key Reconstruction"
/>

Out of the multiple modules available, you can choose the module you want to include in your
implementation. Here is the list of available modules:

- [**Storage Modules**](#storage-modules-share-b): Storage Modules are used to store Shares B in the
  user's device storage.
- [**Recovery Modules**](#recovery-modules-share-c): Recovery Modules are used to recover the Shares
  C and so, in the case user doesn't have access to their device/storage or needs additional
  security.
- [**Additional Modules**](#additional-modules): These modules provide extra capability to the tKey
  SDK, like importing users' existing private keys or seed phrases.
