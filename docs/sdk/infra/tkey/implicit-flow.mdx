If you're looking for using an implicit authentication flow in your application, you can use the
Torus Service Provider SDK to do so. The Torus Service Provider is built on top of the `CustomAuth`
SDK from Web3Auth, which is an internal library used in the PnP SDKs to provide a common interface
for authentication. Here, you need to do some additional setup to enable the SDK to be able to catch
the authentication redirect.

This guide will help you in setting up the Torus Service Provider SDK in your application. It is a 3
step process in general:

- Instantiating the Torus Service Provider
- Initiating the Service Provider Instance within tKey
- Handling the OAuth Redirection
- Triggering Login

## Instantiation

Service Provider in `tKey` is used for generating a [**Share A**](/sdk/infra/tkey), i.e. the private
key share managed by a wallet service provider via their authentication flows. This share in our
[wallet infrastructure](/infrastructure/) refers to the social login aspect, where we associate a
private key share with the user's social login, enabling the seamless login experience.

#### [`@tkey/service-provider-torus`](https://npmjs.com/package/@tkey/service-provider-torus)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/service-provider-torus
```

### Parameters

```tsx
class TorusServiceProvider extends ServiceProviderBase {
  customAuthInstance: CustomAuth;
  singleLoginKey: BN;
  torusKey: TorusKey;
  migratableKey: BN | null;
  customAuthArgs: CustomAuthArgs;
  constructor({ enableLogging, postboxKey, customAuthArgs }: TorusServiceProviderArgs);
  static fromJSON(value: StringifiedType): TorusServiceProvider;
  init(params: InitParams): Promise<void>;
  triggerLogin(params: SubVerifierDetails): Promise<TorusLoginResponse | null>;
  triggerAggregateLogin(params: AggregateLoginParams): Promise<TorusAggregateLoginResponse>;
  triggerHybridAggregateLogin(
    params: HybridAggregateLoginParams,
  ): Promise<TorusHybridAggregateLoginResponse>;
  toJSON(): StringifiedType;
}
```

<TorusServiceProviderArg />

#### Usage

<TorusServiceProviderExample />

## Initializing Service Provider

You need to initialize your Service Provider within your constructor function to use it while
logging your user in through the social accounts. This is done by calling the `init()` function
within the `tKey` instance's `serviceProvider` property.

```
tKey.serviceProvider.init(initParams);
```

### Parameters

<TorusServiceProviderInitParams />

#### Usage

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const init = async () => {
    // Initialization of Service Provider
    try {
      await (tKey.serviceProvider as any).init();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };
  init();
}, []);
```

## Handling Redirection

In the Implicit Flow, you need to set up a redirect page to capture the authentication redirect.
This is needed since the authentication redirect contains the authentication information of the
user, which is needed to generate the OAuthKey. The redirect page is used to capture this
information and pass it over to the Torus Service Provider.

The `uxMode` parameter in the `customAuthArgs` object is used to determine the type of redirect page
to be used. There are two types of redirect

- **Popup Mode (default):** We deploy a service worker to capture the redirect.
- **Redirect Mode:** You need to create a redirect page to capture the redirect.

### Redirect Page

You can get login result by calling `getRedirectResult` on redirected page mount. For example, if
baseUrl is `http://localhost:3000` and `redirectPathName` is `auth` then user will be redirected to
`http://localhost:3000/auth` page after login where you can get login result by calling
`getRedirectResult` on redirected page mount.

#### Usage

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const init = async () => {
    // Initialization of Service Provider
    try {
      // Init is required for Redirect Flow but skip fetching sw.js and redirect.html )
      (tKey.serviceProvider as any).init({ skipInit: true });
      if (window.location.pathname === "/auth" && window.location.hash.includes("#state")) {
        let result = await (tKey.serviceProvider as any).directWeb.getRedirectResult();
        tKey.serviceProvider.postboxKey = new BN((result.result as any).privateKey!, "hex");
        await tKey.initialize();
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };
  init();
}, []);
```

### Service Worker

A service worker is a scripts that is run by the browser. It does not have any direct relationship
with the DOM and provides many out of the box network-related features. Web3Auth Core Kit tKey SDK
needs a service worker relative to `baseUrl` to capture the auth redirect at `redirectPathName`
path.

For example, while using service worker if `baseUrl` is `http://localhost:3000/serviceworker` then
user will be redirected to `http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/redirect` page after login where
service worker will capture the results and send it back to original window where login was
initiated.

:::tip

- Using service worker is optional, but highly recommended. You can skip it by passing `skipSw`
  param while [initializing tKey](/sdk/infra/tkey/initialize).

- Service worker is needed if you are using `popup` uxMode within your
  [Service Provider configuration](/sdk/infra/tkey/initialize#configuring-service-provider).

- For browsers where service workers are not supported, or in the case you wish to not use service
  workers, create and serve redirect page (i.e `redirect.html` file).

:::

#### Service Worker Setup

- If you're using React, to setup service worker, you need to create a `sw.js` file in your public
  folder and register it in your `index.html` file. You can find more information about it in
  [this blog](https://blog.bitsrc.io/using-service-workers-with-react-27a4c5e2d1a9).

- For Angular, [this guide](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-getting-started) will be helpful
  in setting up the service worker.

- For Vue,
  [this guide](https://www.360learntocode.com/2020/12/how-to-use-and-customize-service-worker-in-vuejs-pwa.html)
  is a great way to get started with service workers.

#### Service Worker Code

You can directly copy the service worker file code from here and paste in your respective folder.
You can also find the code in our
[tKey JS Examples (Popup Flow)](/examples?product=Core+Kit&sdk=tKey+JS+SDK).

## Log In

The login with the tKey SDK is a two step process. First, you need to trigger the login process by
calling the `triggerLogin()` function of the Service Provider. Following which using the returned
information, use the `initialize()` function of the tKey to generate the Threshold Key corresponding
to the user.

However, before starting this process, you need to set up Custom Authentication on your Web3Auth
Dashboard. For this, you need to [Create a Verifier](/auth-provider-setup/verifiers) from the
**Custom Auth** section of the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) with
your desired configuration.

:::tip

If you want to know more about setting up a verifier and how to use it, please refer to the
[Custom Authentication Documentation](/features/custom-authentication).

### Triggering Login

#### `tKey.serviceProvider.triggerLogin(SubVerifierDetails)`

This is a needed step since this will generate a private key which will be needed by the tKey to
generate it's share. This is done by calling the `triggerLogin()` function within the `tKey`
instance's `serviceProvider`.

<SubVerifierDetails />

#### Usage

```tsx
const loginResponse = await(tKey.serviceProvider as any).triggerLogin({
  typeOfLogin: "google", // "google","facebook","reddit","discord","twitch", etc.
  verifier: "google-tkey-w3a",
  clientId: "774338308167-q463s7kpvja16l4l0kko3nb925ikds2p.apps.googleusercontent.com",
});
const user = loginResponse.userInfo;
console.log("User Details: ", user);
```

### Get User Information

```tsx
triggerLogin(params: SubVerifierDetails): Promise<TorusLoginResponse>;
```

The tKey Service Provider returns a `TorusLoginResponse` object which contains the user's
information and details about the login. You can access the `userInfo` property within it to get the
user details from the login provider.

<TorusLoginResponse />

### Trigger Login using Aggregate Verifier

#### `triggerAggregateLogin()`

```javascript
await (tKey.serviceProvider as TorusServiceProvider).triggerAggregateLogin(AggregateLoginParams)
```

Takes in the aggregate verifier details as `AggregateLoginParams`.

```tsx
interface AggregateLoginParams {
  aggregateVerifierType: AGGREGATE_VERIFIER_TYPE;
  verifierIdentifier: string;
  subVerifierDetailsArray: SubVerifierDetails[];
}
```
