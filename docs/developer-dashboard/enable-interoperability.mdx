One of the most exciting features of Web3Auth is around its interoperability with Torus Wallet. This means that the private key generated within your
application with Web3Auth can be used to sign transactions within Torus Wallet on other applications. This enables a dApp to choose if they want to
give the user the flexibility of moving funds around using Torus wallet, without the headache of making the flows for it themselves. Additionally, to
further improve the interoperability, a user can connect to other wallets and dApps using WalletConnect flow within Torus Wallet.

## Using the Web3Auth Dashboard Toggles

Within the Web3Auth Dashboard, while setting up a new Plug and Play project, or editing an existing one, you have the option to configure
interoperability with Torus Wallet. To enable it, you need to do the following steps:

- Create a new / edit your existing Plug and Play project

  <img src={CreateImageUrl} style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "400px", margin: "20px auto" }} alt="" />

<div className="text-image-column">
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Select the chain you want your dApp to interact with. For interoperability, you have the option between <code>EVM based chains</code>,{" "}
        <code>Solana</code> &<code>Casper</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src={CreateDashboardPnp} style={{ minWidth: "200px", maxWidth: "250px" }} alt="" />
  </div>
</div>

- Once you have selected one of the chains supported by Torus Wallet, you can now select the option `Allow user's private key usage in given wallets:`
  to enable interoperable flow with the Torus Wallets. These wallets can be accessed on the following domains:

<div className="text-image-column">
  <div>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>EVM Wallet</b> - https://app.tor.us
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Solana Wallet</b> - https://solana.tor.us
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Casper Wallet</b> - https://casper.tor.us
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src={CreateDashboardPnp4} style={{ minWidth: "300px", maxWidth: "350px" }} alt="" />
  </div>
</div>
<br />

And you're done! Now, your user can use their Web3Auth private key from your application to sign transactions within Torus Wallet.
