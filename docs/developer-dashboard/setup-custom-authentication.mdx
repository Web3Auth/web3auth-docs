This is the Custom Authentication section of the dashboard. It is where you can create a new Custom Authentication verifier.

Custom Authentication refers to the capability of hooking up your own custom authentication flow with Web3Auth. This gives you the flexibility of
using any authentication/ verification flow you want, providing us the verification token and the user details, and let Web3Auth do the rest.

The Custom Authentication Dashboard looks something like this:

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Image6} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>
<br />

To get started, you need to create a verifier to let user login with your custom authentication flow. Verifier scripts determine the access structure
to your users keys and the set Verifier Scripts chosen determine which logins your application will ultimately use. You can read more about verifiers
[here](../customauth/verifiers.mdx)

## Creating a Verifier

Once you click on the Create Verifier button, you'll see a toggle similar to this:

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Image7} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>
<br />
To create a verifier, you need to input the following details:

### Verifier identifier

The identifier for your verifier. This is used to identify your verifier in the Web3Auth dashboard. You'll need this while initialising the
Web3AuthCore SDK for setting up custom login.

### Select Network

Select between `testnet` and `mainnet`. `testnet` is a sandbox environment for developers to experiment. People usually test and finish their
integration here. `mainnet` is production environment for scalable applications.

### Verifier Type

Select the type of verifier you want to create. We've pre provided a few common flows you can choose from, but you can also choose `Custom` and
provide all the JWT details.
