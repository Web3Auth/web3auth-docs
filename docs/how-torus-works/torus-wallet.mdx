title: Torus Wallet
---

To make our key management solution usable for DApps, we provide a Web3
interface that interfaces with an iframe that holds the private key for the user
in a separate javascript context. All communications to nodes, third-party
authentication servers, as well as message signing, are done in this separate
javascript iframe context that is loaded on some [tor.us](https://tor.us)
subdomain.

As such, Torus wallet consists of a javascript Web3 SDK
\([torus-embed](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-embed)\) and the site
that is loaded in the iframe
\([torus-website](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-website)\).

## Integrity hashes

To ensure content integrity for the Torus wallet, all imported files in the
Torus wallet are integrity hashed, and the resulting javascript SDK also has an
integrity hash. We also go one step further to ensure that it's not possible for
the Torus development team to modify the wallet after release by ensuring that
the torus-embed SDK keeps an integrity hash of a particular static release of
torus-website, and checks that the iframe's contents matches this integrity
hash. As long as you do not update your installed version of the torus-embed
javascript, even if the Torus team hosts a malicious version of torus-website,
your torus-embed SDK will refuse to load it. We also use integrity hashes for
our service workers to the same effect. Both of these are not currently natively
supported by browsers at the moment but we use a fetch-validate-cache-and-load
method to achieve this.

These integrity hashes help to ensure that the Torus wallet front-end cannot be
freely modified by the Torus team post-release. All releases are versioned and
will always be accessible at app.tor.us/vX.XX.XX.

## Popups

Unfortunately, modals are prone to clickjacking attacks. For security reasons,
we have implemented all user confirmation screens as popups.
