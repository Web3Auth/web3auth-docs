Torus nodes run a Distributed Key Generation protocol amongst themselves to assign, store
and return secrets/keys to users. In general within Torus Key Infrastructure, nodes manage
a share retrieved via conventional OAuth flows.

The architecture consists of four parts:‌

- Nodes in charge of Distributed Key Generation \(DKG\)
- A smart contract in charge of the management of nodes
- A private BFT network between nodes
- A front-end client/SDK that interacts with nodes

A smart contract is used for node discovery. Nodes are selected, operate for a
fixed period, and generate a set of keys via DKG.‌

When a user arrives at a DApp, the client is loaded. From there, a user logs in,
they provide proof that they are logged in, and the proof is verified by each
node individually. This proof is integrated with the modern OAuth 2.0 Token
Authentication flow. For new users, nodes will assign a new key share from the
pre-generated set of key shares, and store this assignment in an internal
mapping. For returning users, nodes will look up their internal mapping and
return that user's corresponding key share.‌

The client then assembles these shares and reconstructs the users key in the
front-end.
