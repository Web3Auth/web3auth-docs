[Safe](https://safe.global/) is a platform that makes it possible for anyone to own a digital account. It establishes universal and transparent
standards for the storage of digital assets, data, and identity. With **[SafeAuth Kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@safe-global/auth-kit)**, you can
easily create smart wallets that work seamlessly with [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337), using the user's EOA as the smart wallet's
signer. This simplifies the process of incorporating [Account Abstraction](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction/) features into your
application.

:::tip

Check out our [**example app**](https://w3a-safe-demo.vercel.app/) and
[**repository**](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/tree/main/web-modal-sdk/account-abstraction/web3auth-safe-example) for an
end-to-end **Web3Auth** and **SafeAuth Kit integration**.

  <summary>
    <b>What is an EOA?</b>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <p>
      An{" "}
      <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/" target="_blank">
        <b>EOA, or externally-owned account</b>
      </a>{" "}
      is a type of Ethereum account that is controlled by a private key. EOAs can be created through Web3Auth, or by using external wallets such as
      MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow Wallet, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, there are <b>contract accounts</b> that are controlled by smart contract codes and do not have their own private key. Safe's
      smart wallet is a contract account that has{" "}
      <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction/" target="_blank">
        enhanced capabilities, such as gas sponsorship and batched transactions.
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since contract accounts do not have their own private key, they require a <b>signer</b> to initiate transaction flows and produce signatures.
      Signers are usually EOAs that authorize actions taken by the contract account via a signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this integration, the user's EOA (from Web3Auth) serves as the signer for their smart wallet (from Safe). The smart wallet (Safe) holds all
      assets and submits all transactions to the network. However, the signer (Web3Auth) is responsible for producing signatures and "kicking off"
      transaction flows.

## Install SafeAuth Kit

To get started, install the [`@safe-global/auth-kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@safe-global/auth-kit) SDK from Safe.

```bash
npm i @safe-global/auth-kit
```

## Create a SafeAuthPack instance

To integrate SafeAuth into your application, start by creating an instance of the `SafeAuthPack` class from the
[`@safe-global/auth-kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@safe-global/auth-kit) package. This instance will be the entry point for managing
authentication and transactions.

```typescript
import { SafeAuthPack, SafeAuthConfig, SafeAuthInitOptions } from "@safe-global/auth-kit";

const safeAuthInitOptions: SafeAuthInitOptions = {
  showWidgetButton: false, // Set to true to show the SafeAuth widget button
  chainConfig: {
    blockExplorerUrl: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io", // The block explorer URL
    chainId: "0xaa36a7", // The chain ID
    displayName: "Ethereum Sepolia", // The chain name
    rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia", // The RPC target
    ticker: "ETH", // The chain ticker
    tickerName: "Ethereum", // The chain ticker name
  },
};

const safeAuthPack = new SafeAuthPack();
await safeAuthPack.init(safeAuthInitOptions);
```

You should always call the `init()` method afterward before interacting with the pack. The init method initializes the provided Web3Auth SDK and Safe
services. It creates an embedded browser wallet within an iframe, establishing communication through the internally generated EIP-1193 provider.

## Sign in to an Ethereum account

### Sign In

To start the authentication process, simply call the `signIn()` method. This method is usually triggered when a user clicks on a `Sign In` button on
your web application. Once the user has successfully signed in, a new Ethereum Wallet will be created. This wallet will be utilized for all future
logins and can be **shared across different applications**.

```typescript
const safeAuthSignInResponse = await safeAuthPack.signIn();
```

The returned safeAuthSignInResponse contains the user's Ethereum address and associated Safe addresses.

> This method retrieves Safe addresses owned by the EOA, but does not create a Safe.

```typescript
AuthKitSignInData {
  eoa: string // The safe signer
  safes?: string[] // The list of associated Safe addresses in the chain
}
```

### Create Safe

> Creation of a Safe is done by using the SafeFactory from the [Protocol Kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@safe-global/protocol-kit). The Protocol
> Kit is a library that provides a set of tools to interact with the Safe smart contract.

**To create a Safe, use the following code:**

```typescript
import { ethers, BrowserProvider, Eip1193Provider } from "ethers";
import { EthersAdapter, SafeFactory } from "@safe-global/protocol-kit";

const provider = new BrowserProvider(safeAuthPack?.getProvider() as Eip1193Provider);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();
const ethAdapter = new EthersAdapter({
  ethers,
  signerOrProvider: signer,
} as any);

const safeFactory = await SafeFactory.create({ ethAdapter });
const safe = await safeFactory.deploySafe({
  safeAccountConfig: { threshold: 1, owners: [safeAuthSignInResponse?.eoa as string] },
});
console.log("SAFE Created!", await safe.getAddress());
```

### Provider

After authentication, use `getProvider()` to obtain the Ethereum provider instance, compatible with **EIP-1193**.

```typescript
safeAuthPack.getProvider();
```

### Sign Out

To sign out the user, use the `signOut()` method.

```typescript
await safeAuthPack.signOut();
```

## Signing and executing transactions

Combine SafeAuth Kit with the Protocol Kit to connect to a Safe and perform transactions.

```typescript
import { ethers, BrowserProvider, Eip1193Provider } from "ethers";
import { EthersAdapter } from "@safe-global/protocol-kit";

const provider = new BrowserProvider(safeAuthPack?.getProvider() as Eip1193Provider);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();

// Create the Safe EthersAdapter
const ethAdapter = new EthersAdapter({
  ethers,
  signerOrProvider: signer || provider,
});

const safeAddress = safeAuthSignInResponse?.safes?.[0] || "0x";

// Instantiate the protocolKit
const protocolKit = await Safe.create({
  ethAdapter,
  safeAddress,
});

// Create a Safe transaction with the provided parameters
const safeTransactionData: MetaTransactionData = {
  to: ethers.getAddress(safeAuthSignInResponse?.eoa || "0x"),
  data: "0x",
  value: ethers.parseUnits("0.0001", "ether").toString(),
};

const safeTransaction = await protocolKit.createTransaction({
  safeTransactionData,
});

// Sign transaction
const tx = await protocolKit.signTransaction(safeTransaction);

// Execute the transaction
const txResult = await protocolKit.executeTransaction(tx);
```

## Sign messages using the `SafeAuthPack`

Sign messages or transactions using your preferred web3 library.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="web3"
  values={[
    { label: "web3.js", value: "web3" },
    { label: "ethers.js", value: "ethers" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="web3">

```typescript
// Using web3
const web3 = new Web3(safeAuthPack.getProvider());

const message = "Safe meets Web3Auth";
const address = safeAuthSignInResponse?.eoa || "0x";
await web3.eth.personal.sign(message, address);
await web3.eth.signTransaction(tx);
await web3.eth.sendTransaction(tx);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ethers">

```typescript
// Using ethers
const provider = new BrowserProvider(safeAuthPack?.getProvider() as Eip1193Provider);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();

await signer.signMessage(message);

await signer.signTransaction(tx);
await signer.sendTransaction(tx);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The integration makes use of Web3Auth Wallet Services to offer users a secure and hassle-free authentication experience.
