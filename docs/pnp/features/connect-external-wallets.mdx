One of the most interesting capabilities of Web3Auth includes the ability to directly connect to external wallet providers like MetaMask,
WalletConnect, Coinbase and more, enabling seamless onboarding of crypto native alongside the social login aspect for non crypto native users. This
allows your application to be able to support all the required authentication flows with just a simple integration. These capabilities are enabled by
our modular SDK, where each login provider is an `adapter` that can be plugged into the SDK.

:::note

Please note that these capabilities of connecting to multiple wallets is only available for the Web SDKs, currently these adapters are not available
for Mobile and Gaming SDKs.

:::info Integrate the wallet of your choice

Currently Web3Auth support the following wallets, please go to their respective SDK References to integrate them into your project:

- [Torus EVM Wallet](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/torus-evm)
- [Torus Solana Wallet](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/torus-solana)
- [MetaMask](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/metamask)
- [Phantom Wallet](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/phantom)
- [WalletConnect V1](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/wallet-connect-v1)
- [Coinbase Wallet](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/coinbase)
- [Slope Wallet](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/slope)
- [Solflare Wallet](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/solflare)

## Understanding Adapters

Adapters are essentially connectors between Web3Auth and the underlying wallet provider. For example, an adapter for connecting with torus wallet is
available under web3auth as [@web3auth/torus-evm-adapter](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/torus-evm). Every adapter follows a common interface which is required
by Web3Auth to communicate with the wallet.

An adapter emits certain events like `CONNECTED`, `CONNECTING` and `DISCONNECTED` etc during login lifecycle of a user. Each adapter exposes provider
on successful user login which can be used to invoke RPC calls on wallet and on connected blockchain.

Hence, adapters are needed to connect your Web3Auth instance to a wallet provider. Web3Auth by default contains a pre-configured list of login
adapters. It also provides flexibility to add/remove adapters or to use some existing adapter with custom configurations. To configure an adapter
create an instance of the adapter by using its corresponding package and pass the returned adapter instance in the `configureAdapter` function.

For example, to configure openlogin adapter,

- Import the `OpenloginAdapter` from the `@web3auth/openlogin-adapter` package.
- Create an instance of the adapter along with the configuration
- Pass the returned instance to `web3auth.configureAdapter` as shown in the example below.

```tsx
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter";

const openloginAdapter = await OpenloginAdapter({
  adapterSettings: {
    network: "sapphire_mainnet",
    uxMode: "popup",
  },
});

web3auth.configureAdapter(openloginAdapter);
```

## Currently Available Wallet Adapters

By default Web3Auth's modal UI supports a set of default adapters depending on the `authMode` being used. By default, Web3Auth requires basic
configuration `client_id`, and registering a redirect if you are using CustomAuth adapter from the dashboard.

The table below summarizes all the available adapters and their properties

### Types of Wallet Adapters

Currently Web3Auth supports two categories of wallet adapters:

- `IN_APP` Application Wallets
- `EXTERNAL` External Wallets

#### Application Wallets

- Application wallets are those wallets which are scoped to dApp. This means that if you are logging in with the same application wallet on different
  applications, you will get different wallets (private keys).
- `openlogin`, `torus-evm` and `torus-solana` are Application Wallets.

#### External Wallets

- External wallet are those which are global for all applications. No matter where you are logging in, you will get same wallets if same credentials
  are being provided.
- `metamask`, `phantom` and `walletconnect-v1`, `coinbase`, `slope`, `solflare` are External Wallets in Web3Auth.
