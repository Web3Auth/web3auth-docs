For adding your own authentication, you have to first configure your verifiers in the Web3Auth Dashboard. Have a look at this documentation for
configuring that first

#### `web3authCore.connectTo(adapter, loginParams)`

After initializing you can login/connect with any adapter by calling `connectTo` function along with adapter name.

```javascript
// connect to any adapter by passing adapter name in connectTo function.
// connectTo has two parameters, first is adapter name and second is configuration specific to the adapter.
connectTo<T>(walletName: WALLET_ADAPTER_TYPE, loginParams?: T): Promise<SafeEventEmitterProvider | null>;
```

#### Example

```ts
const provider = await web3authCore.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    id_token: jwtToken,
    domain: "YOUR_APP_DOMAIN",
    verifierIdField: "sub",
  },
});
```
