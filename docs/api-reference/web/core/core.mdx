# Web3Auth Plug and Play Core

---

## [`@web3auth/core`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/web3auth)

import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";

Web3Auth Plug and Play Core is the main SDK that consists of the core module of Web3Auth Plug and Play. This SDK gives you all the needed modules for
implementing the Web3Auth features, giving you the flexibility of implementing your own UI to use all the functionalities. Since this package doesn't
contain the UI Modal as compared to [`@web3auth/web3auth`](../web3auth) package, the size of this package is smaller.

## Installation

---

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: "npm", value: "npm" },
    { label: "yarn", value: "yarn" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/core
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @web3auth/core
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Consider adding `@web3auth/base` to your project

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: "npm", value: "npm" },
    { label: "yarn", value: "yarn" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @web3auth/base
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you
need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with `typescript`.
