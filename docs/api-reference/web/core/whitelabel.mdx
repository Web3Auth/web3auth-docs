### Create a new instance of Web3Auth

#### Import the `Web3AuthCore` class from `@web3auth/core`;

```javascript
import { Web3AuthCore } from "@web3auth/core";
```

#### Assign the `Web3Auth` class to a variable

```javascript
const web3auth = new Web3AuthCore(options);
```

This Web3Auth constructor takes an object with `Web3AuthOptions` as input.

#### Parameters

- `options` - `Web3AuthOptions`: The options of the constructor

If you are a wallet and only want to use you own wallet implementations, then you should use `WALLET` authMode. | `DAPP`                                               |

#### Returns

- `Object`: The web3auth instance with all its methods and events.

#### Adding a Custom Chain Configuration

```ts
type CustomChainConfig = {
  chainNamespace: ChainNamespaceType;
  /*
   The chain id of the chain
  */
  chainId: string;
  /*
   RPC target Url for the chain
  */
  rpcTarget: string;
  /*
   Display Name for the chain
  */
  displayName: string;
  /*
   Url of the block explorer
   */
  blockExplorer: string;
  /*
   Default currency ticker of the network (e.g: ETH)
  */
  ticker: string;
  /*
   Name for currency ticker (e.g: `Ethereum`)
  */
  tickerName: string;
};
```

#### Example

```javascript
/*
This instance will create DAPP based modal which uses ropsten network for all
the adapters being passed (unless override while configuring  adapters,
each adapter can be configured to have its own chainConfig, otherwise each adapter
will inherit chainConfig based on the chainNamespace and chainId passed in the
constructor chainConfig).
*/

const web3authCore = new Web3AuthCore({
  chainConfig: { chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155, chainId: "0x3" },
  authMode: "DAPP",
  clientId: "example-client-id", // get your client id from developer dashboard
});
```

### Configuring Adapters

Web3Auth's modal UI supports a set of default adapters depends of the `authMode` being used. By default, Web3Auth requires basic configuration
`clientId`, and registering a redirect if you using custom authentication.

To configure an adapter, create the instance of adapter by using its corresponding package and pass the returned `adapter` instance in
`configureAdapter` function.

> Note: You don't have to configure any default adapter unless you want to override default configs for the adapter. Only those adapter which are
> marked are non default [in this table on the Adapters Documentation](./adapters#currently-available-adapters) are required to be configured always
> based on the `authMode` you are using.

#### Refer to the [Adapters documentation](./adapters) to know more deeply about what adapters are available and how to configure them.

#### Example

If you want to configure the openlogin adapter

- Import the `OpenloginAdapter` from `@web3auth/openlogin-adapter` package
- Create an instance of the adapter along with the configuration
- Pass the returned instance in to `web3auth.configureAdapter`

```ts
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter";

const openloginAdapter = await OpenloginAdapter({
  adapterSettings: {
    network: "testnet",
    clientId: "example-client-id",
    uxMode: "popup",
  },
  loginSettings: {
    relogin: true,
  },
});

web3authCore.configureAdapter(openloginAdapter);
```

### Whitelabel

Since you're using Custom UI, you don't need to add any default UI. You can add your own UI for the login flow. That being said, you have the ability
to configure the adapters and whitelabel them according to your needs.

To know more in depth about how you can Whitelabel your application with Web3Auth, have a look at our [**Whitelabeling Guide**](/whitelabeling).

### Subscribing the Lifecycle Events

- `CONNECTED`: User is logged in and connected with the dApp
- `CONNECTING`: User is connecting to the dApp/ login process is in progress
- `DISCONNECTED`: User is logged out and disconnected from the dApp
- `ERRORED`: There has been some error in connecting the user to the dApp

### Initialization

#### `web3authCore.init()`

After you are done with configuring your adapters, you can initialize all these adapter by calling init function of web3auth core instance.

This method will initialize all the adapter that you have configured.

:::note

In case initialization of any adapter fails it will not throw but simply allow you to connect with successfully initialized adapters.

:::

```javascript
await web3authCore.init();
```
