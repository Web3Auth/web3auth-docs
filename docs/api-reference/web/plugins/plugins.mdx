Plugins are essentially extensions to the core functionality of Web3Auth, allowing you to add additional features to your dApp. These features can be
used to extend the UI functionalities, making your integration more interoperable, and a lot more, even having the functionality to be customised
extremely and to your liking. Our aim is to progressively add more features to make developing with Web3Auth easier and flexible for the community.

Currently, Web3Auth supports UI plugins for wallet operations, helping you with flows to add funds, manage transactions and much more. This helps you
avoid making wallet flows within your application. Additionally, for interoperability with multiple applications, these packages give you the
advantage of using the same key from Web3Auth across multiple applications.

You can explore the API reference for our UI plugins in this section.
