The default adapter of Web3Auth is the [`openlogin-adapter`](../openlogin). This adapter is a wrapper around the [`openlogin`](../openlogin) library
from Web3Auth and enables the social login features. For customising features of the main Web3Auth flow, like [Whitelabel](./whitelabel),
[Custom Authentication](./custom-authentication), etc. you need to customise the Openlogin Adapter.

:::tip

Checkout the [`openlogin-adapter`](../openlogin) API Reference for more details on different configurations you can pass for customisations.

#### Whitelabeling

##### `whiteLabel`

For customising the redirect screens while logging in and constructing the key, you need to pass on `whiteLabel` configurations to the
[`openlogin-adapter`](../openlogin).

:::tip

This is just one of the aspects of whitelabeling you can achieve with Web3Auth. To know more in depth about how you can Whitelabel your application
with Web3Auth Plug and Play SDK, have a look at our [Whitelabeling API Reference](./whitelabel).
