While installing Web3Auth Self Host, you have two options.

- [Standard Installation](#standard-installation): Get yourself started with all the available Tkey SDKs & Modules and configure your application
  accordingly.
- [Custom Installation](#custom-installation): Pick and choose the Tkey SDKs & Modules you want to use for your implementation.

## Standard Installation

---

For the standard installation, we recommend installing the `tkey/default` SDK. This package contains all the needed functionalities of the `tkey` SDK.
Within one bundle you can import all the needed SDKs and get started with working on your Web3Auth Self Host implementation.

### [`@tkey/default`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/default)

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: "npm", value: "npm" },
    { label: "yarn", value: "yarn" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install --save @tkey/default
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @tkey/default
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Custom Installation

---

For the standard installation, you can pick and choose the SDKs and Modules you want to include. To start off, you need to install the `tkey/core`
SDK. This SDK is needed for setting up the basic functionality, ie. generating a `tkey`.

### [`@tkey/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/core)

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: "npm", value: "npm" },
    { label: "yarn", value: "yarn" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install --save @tkey/core
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @tkey/core
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Adding a Service Provider

For generating a [**Share B**](./introduction), ie. the private key share managed by a wallet service provider via their own authentication flows, you
need to install one of the following packages:

- [`@tkey/service-provider-torus`](service-provider#base-service-provider)
- [`@tkey/service-provider-base`](service-provider#torus-service-provider)

### Adding a Storage Layer

A storage layer is needed to store and recall the metadata information of the shares generated so as to be able to recover the private key from the
tkeys generated. For this we use the `@tkey/storage-layer-torus` SDK, giving you the ability to get and set the Metadata for the various shares
generated. You can read about how it works from the [Initialization API Reference](./initialization).

#### [`@tkey/storage-layer-torus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/storage-layer-torus)

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: "npm", value: "npm" },
    { label: "yarn", value: "yarn" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install --save @tkey/storage-layer-torus
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @tkey/storage-layer-torus
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Webpack 5 Issues

With the latest version of webpack, you might face issues mentioning that certain dependencies are missing. These dependencies need to be polyfilled
in your application and your app needs to be reconfigured to use them while building. Checkout out our
[dedicated guide](/troubleshooting/webpack-issues) for fixing it, if you're facing this problem.
