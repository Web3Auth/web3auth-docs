# Web3Auth Self Host SDKs

If you want a more customised integration with Web3Auth, you have the option to try out `tkey` SDK, which is one of the core infrastructural component
of Web3Auth. `tkey` stands for Threshold Key, which refers to the key share generated using threshold cryptography.

The `tkey` manages private keys by generating shares of it using Shamir Secret Sharing. The user starts by generating (client-side) a 2 out of 3 (2/3)
Shamir secret sharing. This gives the user three shares: ShareA, ShareB, and ShareC.

- **ShareA** is stored on the userâ€™s device: Implementation is device and system specific. For example, on mobile devices, the share could be stored
  in device storage secured via biometrics.
- **ShareB** is managed by a service provider: This share is kept and managed by a wallet service provider via their own authentication flows.
- **ShareC** is a recovery share: An extra share to be kept by the user, possibly kept on a seperate device, downloaded or based on user input with
  enough entropy (eg. password, security questions, hardware device etc.).

Similar to existing 2FA systems, a user needs to prove ownership of at least 2 out of 3 (2/3) shares, in order to retrieve his private key.

:::tip

This setup can be further customised using the `tkey` SDK according to your own needs. To know more about how our infrastructure works, checkout our
[Key Management Documentation](/overview/key-management)

:::

:::caution

Since this setup is being hosted on your own servers, we cannot guarantee the total self-custodiality of the users' keys. The server configuration
will decide the custodiality of the users' keys. If you want to use a true self custodial setup without any hassle from your side, we will recommend
you to use our [Plug and Play SDKs](/api-reference/web/) rather.
