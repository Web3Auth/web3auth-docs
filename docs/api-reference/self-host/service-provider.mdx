Service Provider in `tKey` is used for generating a [**Share B**](./introduction), ie. the private key share managed by a wallet service provider via
their own authentication flows. This share in the Web3Auth Plug and Play setup generally refers to the social login aspect, where we associate a
private key share with the social login of the user, enabling the seemless login experience.

In the Web3Auth Self Host setup, you can use the Web3Auth Service Provider (`@tkey/service-provider-torus`), which is basically implements Web3Auth's
Social Login feature as a service provider, enabling you to associate the social login of the user as one of the shares.

:::note

For enabling this, you need [Create a Verifier](/custom-authentication/verifiers) from the **Custom Auth** section of the
[Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/home/customauth) with your desired configuration.

:::

:::tip

If you want to know more about setting up a verifier and how to use it, please refer to the
[Custom Authentication Documentation](/custom-authentication).

## Installation

---

#### [`@tkey/service-provider-torus`](https://npmjs.com/package/@tkey/service-provider-torus)

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: "npm", value: "npm" },
    { label: "yarn", value: "yarn" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install --save @tkey/service-provider-torus
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @tkey/service-provider-torus
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Instantiation

---

#### Import the `TorusServiceProvider` class from `@tkey/service-provider-torus`

```javascript
import TorusServiceProvider from "@tkey/service-provider-torus";
```

#### Assign the `TorusServiceProvider` class to a variable

```javascript
const serviceProvider = new TorusServiceProvider({ TorusServiceProviderArgs });
```

### Parameters

#### `TorusServiceProviderArgs`

<ServiceProviderArg />

### Service Worker

Web3Auth Direct SDK installs a service worker relative to baseUrl to capture the auth redirect at `redirectPathName` path.

:::info example

While using serviceworker if baseUrl is `http://localhost:3000/serviceworker` and `redirectPathName` is `redirect` (which is default) then user will
be redirected to `http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/redirect` page after login where service worker will capture the results and send it back to
original window where login was initiated.

:::

:::note

Using serviceworker is optional, you can skip it by passing `skipSw` param in init function.

:::

Use of serviceworker is recommended if you are using `popup` uxMode or for browsers where service workers are not supported or if you wish to not use
service workers, create and serve redirect page (i.e `redirect.html` file which is available in serviceworker folder of this package).

In `redirect` uxMode, you don't have to use serviceworker or `redirect.html` file. You can get login result by calling `getRedirectResult` on
redirected page mount.

:::info example

if baseUrl is `http://localhost:3000` and `redirectPathName` is `auth` then user will be redirected to `http://localhost:3000/auth` page after login
where you can get login result by calling `getRedirectResult` on redirected page mount.

### Returns

The `TorusServiceProvider` class returns an object with the following properties:

<ServiceProviderReturn />

#### Example

<ServiceProviderExample />

## Initialization

---

#### `init()`

If you're using the Web3Auth Service Provider, you need to initialize it within your constructor function so as to use it while logging your user in
through the social accounts. This is done by calling the `init()` function within the `tKey` instance's `serviceProvider` property.

```javascript
await (tKey.serviceProvider as TorusServiceProvider).init(initParams);
```

#### `initParams`

The `init` function in TorusServiceProvider accepts the following parameters:

<InitParams />

### Example

```js
await (tKey.serviceProvider as TorusServiceProvider).init({ skipSw: false });
```

## Triggering Login

---

#### `triggerLogin()`

Once you have initialised the Web3Auth Service Provider, you're ready to trigger the login process. This is a needed step since this will generate a
private key which will be needed by the tKey to generate it's share. This is done by calling the `triggerLogin()` function within the `tKey`
instance's `serviceProvider` property.

```javascript
await (tKey.serviceProvider as TorusServiceProvider).triggerLogin(SubVerifierDetails)
```

<SubVerifierDetails />

### Returns

```ts
triggerLogin(params: SubVerifierDetails): Promise<TorusLoginResponse>;
```

<TorusLoginResponse />

### Example

<TriggerLoginExample />

## Trigger Login using an Aggregate Verifier

---

#### `triggerAggregateLogin()`

```javascript
await (tKey.serviceProvider as TorusServiceProvider).triggerAggregateLogin(AggregateLoginParams)
```

Takes in the aggregate verifier details as `AggregateLoginParams`.

```ts
interface AggregateLoginParams {
  aggregateVerifierType: AGGREGATE_VERIFIER_TYPE;
  verifierIdentifier: string;
  subVerifierDetailsArray: SubVerifierDetails[];
}
```

### Return

Similar Return as [`triggerLogin`](#torusloginresponse), but for the Aggregate Verifier

## Trigger Login using an Hybrid Aggregate Verifier

#### `triggerHybridAggregateLogin()`

```javascript
await (tKey.serviceProvider as TorusServiceProvider).triggerHybridAggregateLogin(HybridAggregateLoginParams)
```

Takes in the aggregate verifier details as `HybridAggregateLoginParams`.

```ts
export interface HybridAggregateLoginParams {
  singleLogin: SubVerifierDetails;
  aggregateLoginParams: AggregateLoginParams;
}
```

### Return

Returns an object containing

1. `singleLogin`: [`TorusLoginResponse`](#torusloginresponse)
2. `aggregateLogins`: [`TorusKey[]`](#toruskey)
