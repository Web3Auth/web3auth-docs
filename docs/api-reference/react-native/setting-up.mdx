## Installation

---

### Web3Auth React Native SDK

#### [`web3auth-react-native-sdk`](https://github.com/web3auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk)

```sh
npm install @web3auth/react-native-sdk
```

We will also require a `WebBrowser` implementation to allow our JS-based SDK to interact with the native APIs, and there are different extra
installation steps depending on whether you are using the bare workflow or managed workflow. Please refer to
[Choosing between workflows](./choose-workflows) to pick the correct implementation.

Before starting, please make sure that you have registered your `redirectUrl` in the [Web3Auth dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/).

#### Bare workflow

When using our SDK with a bare workflow React Native app, you have to install a `WebBrowser` implementation made by us.

```sh
npm install @toruslabs/react-native-web-browser
```

##### Android

- Perform the native [Android integration steps](/api-reference/android/setting-up).
- For Android, the `redirectUrl` parameter is configurable, and has to be added into the `AndroidManifest.xml`.

##### iOS

- Perform the native [iOS integration steps](/api-reference/ios/setting-up).

- You may add the `redirectUrl` to your iOS `Info.plist`, but it is not required.

##### Register the URL scheme you intended to use for redirection

- Android `AndoidManifest.xml` (required)
- iOS `Info.plist` (optional)

:::tip

You may refer to [this example app](https://github.com/torusresearch/openlogin-expo-sdk-bare-demo-2) for more details.

:::

#### Managed Workflow

When using our SDK with a Expo-based React Native app (aka managed workflow, you have to install the `expo-web-browser` package as a `WebBrowser`
implementation.)

```sh
expo install expo-web-browser
```

##### Adding URL scheme

To allow the Expo based SDK to work with exported Expo Android apps, you need to add the designated scheme into `app.json`

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "openloginexposdkexampleexpo"
  }
}
```

:::tip

You may refer to [this example app](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk/tree/master/example) for more details.

## Initialisation

---

### Importing a `WebBrowser` implementation

```typescript
import * as WebBrowser from "@toruslabs/react-native-web-browser";
// or  import * as WebBrowser from "expo-web-browser"; (for expo)
```

### Create an instance

```typescript
import Web3Auth from "@web3auth/react-native-sdk";

const web3auth = new Web3Auth(WebBrowser, {
  // Your clientId obtained from Web3Auth dashboard.
  clientId: "BC5bANkU4-fil7C5s1uKzRfF0VGqbuaxDQiLnQ8WgF7SEA32lGegAhu7dk4dZf3Rk397blIvfWytXwsRvs9dOaQ",
  network: Network.TESTNET,
});
```

#### `SdkInitParams` object

The `Web3Auth` constructor in the React Native SDK take an `SdkInitParams` object respectively as an argument. The fields of such object are listed
below.

| Parameter   | Type                           | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| clientId    | String                         | Yes       | Your Web3Auth project ID obtained from the Web3Auth dashboard                                                                                                                                   |
| network     | enum of OPENLOGIN_NETWORK_TYPE | Yes       | Web3Auth network to run on, either CYAN, MAINNET or TESTNET                                                                                                                                     |
| redirectUrl | String                         | Yes       | The redirectUrl that the Web3Auth login flow will use to redirect back to the app. It is not required to be specified in the Expo based SDK since it will be specified in the `login()` method. |
| loginConfig | LoginConfig                    | No        | A configuration optional object to customize login flow.                                                                                                                                        |
