- For Android, Custom Tab support is required.

## Bare vs Managed Workflows

---

- By a bare workflow, we mean that your React Native or Expo app is entirely built on your own machine. You can customize your app with Swift/Kotlin
  native modules.
- By a managed workflow, we mean that your Expo app is built on your Expo's cloud, so you don't have control over the native modules used in the app.
- You can read more about different workflows in the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/).
