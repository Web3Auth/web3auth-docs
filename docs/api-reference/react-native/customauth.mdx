## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you to use [customauth-react-native-sdk](https://github.com/torusresearch/customauth-react-native-sdk) to integrate
CustomAuth into your iOS application. CustomAuth is Web3Auth's customizable auth solution.

Source code of the example can also be found in the repository.

Fully white-labelled UI/UX paired up to Torus PKI and auth for React Native.

**Important**

This SDK requires native modules and is designed to bring native experience to your React Native app without you doing any work.

If you've already implemented a native auth experience or prefer to use plain JS React Native, you can use
[customauth-web-sdk](https://github.com/torusresearch/customauth-web-sdk), which won't require native modules and can plug into your login system via
`getTorusKey` and `getAggregateTorusKey` function.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm i --save @toruslabs/customauth-react-native-sdk
```

Please refer to the native SDKs for platform-specific configuration.

- [Android SDK](https://github.com/torusresearch/customauth-android-sdk)
- [iOS SDK](https://github.com/torusresearch/customauth-swift-sdk)

### Manual installation

#### iOS

1. In Xcode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `@toruslabs/customauth-react-native-sdk` and add `RNCustomAuthSdk.xcodeproj`
3. In Xcode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libRNCustomAuthSdk.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`
4. Run your project `Cmd+R`

#### Android

1. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainActivity.java`

   - Add `import org.torusresearch.rncustomauth.RNCustomAuthSdkPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file

   - Add `new RNCustomAuthSdkPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method

2. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   include ':customauth-react-native-sdk'
   project(':customauth-react-native-sdk').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/customauth-react-native-sdk/android')
   ```

3. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   compile project(':customauth-react-native-sdk')
   ```

## Usage

Initialize the SDK after your app is mounted (`useEffect` or `componentDidMount`):

```js
import CustomAuth from "@toruslabs/customauth-react-native-sdk";

CustomAuth.init({
  network: "testnet",

  // Final redirect to your app, can be either custom scheme or deep link
  redirectUri: "torusapp://org.torusresearch.customauthexample/redirect",

  // Redirect from browser, some providers don't allow to redirect to custom scheme, you'll need to configure a proxy web address in which case
  browserRedirectUri: "https://scripts.toruswallet.io/redirect.html",
});
```

Trigger user's login:

```js
import CustomAuth from "@toruslabs/customauth-react-native-sdk";

const credentials = await CustomAuth.triggerLogin({
  typeOfLogin: "google", // "facebook", "email_passwordless", "twitter", "discord", etc
  verifier: "acme-google", // Your verifier registered on https://dashboard.web3auth.io
  clientId, // Your OAuth provider's client ID
  jwtParams, // Extra params vary by provider
});
```

## FAQ

1. I got `BigInt not found` build error when building for iOS, what should I do?

Add the following snipplet to your `ios/Podfile`. See `example2/ios/Podfile` for a full example.

```ruby
  post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
      if target.name == "web3.swift"
        target.build_configurations.each do |config|
          config.build_settings["SWIFT_INCLUDE_PATHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]"] = "$(inherited) $(PODS_CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR)/BigInt $(PODS_CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR)/GenericJSON $(PODS_TARGET_SRCROOT)/web3swift/lib/**"
          config.build_settings["SWIFT_INCLUDE_PATHS[sdk=iphoneos*]"] = "$(inherited) $(PODS_CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR)/BigInt $(PODS_CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR)/GenericJSON $(PODS_TARGET_SRCROOT)/web3swift/lib/**"
        end
      end
    end
  end
```

This is a temporary mitigation for broken xcconfig in the podspec of web3.swift. You may know more at
https://github.com/argentlabs/web3.swift/pull/161.
