6. **API References** - Method signatures, parameters, examples
7. **Configuration** - Dashboard setup, project configuration

## IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### PHASE 1: DATA COLLECTION (2-3 days)

**Tasks:**

- Create llms.txt for context
- Extract all code examples from documentation
- Parse MDX files for structured content
- Identify common patterns and Q&A pairs
- Collect troubleshooting data and solutions

**Key Locations:**

- `/docs/sdk/` - All SDK documentation
- `/docs/authentication/` - Authentication guides
- `/docs/connect-blockchain/` - Blockchain integration
- `/docs/troubleshooting/` - Error solutions
- `/docs/migration-guides/` - Version upgrades
- `/src/pages/guides/` - Tutorial content

### PHASE 2: DATA PROCESSING (3-4 days)

**Tasks:**

- Create prompt-completion pairs for training
- Validate code accuracy and syntax
- Categorize content by topic and use case
- Format data for OpenAI fine-tuning (JSONL)
- Quality assurance and validation

**Output Requirements:**

- 3000-5000 high-quality training examples
- Consistent prompt-completion format
- Categorized by: SDK usage, authentication, blockchain, troubleshooting
- Validated code examples with proper imports

### PHASE 3: FINE-TUNING (1-2 days)

**Tasks:**

- Prepare training dataset (80/20 split)
- Configure OpenAI parameters
- Execute fine-tuning process
- Monitor training progress
- Validate model outputs

**Technical Requirements:**

- Model base: GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4
- Training format: JSONL with conversation structure
- System prompt: "You are a Web3Auth integration expert assistant."

### PHASE 4: TESTING & OPTIMIZATION (2-3 days)

**Tasks:**

- Test common integration scenarios
- Evaluate code generation accuracy
- Identify and optimize weak areas
- Create evaluation metrics
- Prepare final deployment

**Success Metrics:**

- Code accuracy: >95% syntactically correct
- Answer relevance: >90% relevant responses
- Problem resolution: >85% correct solutions

## TRAINING DATA STRUCTURE

### CONVERSATION FORMAT

```json
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "You are a Web3Auth integration expert assistant." },
    { "role": "user", "content": "[User question or request]" },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "[Complete answer with code examples]" }
  ]
}
```

### CONTENT CATEGORIES

1. **SDK Initialization** - How to set up different SDKs
2. **Authentication Flows** - Implementing various login methods
3. **Blockchain Connections** - Connecting to different networks
4. **Error Resolution** - Fixing common integration issues
5. **Migration Guidance** - Upgrading between versions
6. **Configuration Help** - Dashboard and project setup

## QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

### CODE VALIDATION

- All code must be syntactically correct
- Include all necessary imports
- Match documented SDK versions
- Be immediately executable

### CONTENT ACCURACY

- Technically accurate information
- Up-to-date with latest SDK versions
- Consistent terminology
- Complete examples with context

## DELIVERABLES

### EVALUATION DOCUMENTS (COMPLETED)

- `openai-finetuning-evaluation.yaml` - Main evaluation
- `openai-finetuning-implementation-guide.yaml` - Step-by-step guide
