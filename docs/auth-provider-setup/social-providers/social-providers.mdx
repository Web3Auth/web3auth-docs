This section goes deeper into setting up the social login providers and configuring their respective
verifiers within Web3Auth Dashboard. There are parts that deep dive into both the OAuth standards,
authentication flow, managing API keys, and securing user data—all while providing a frictionless
login experience. You can also register your app directly with
[implicit grant support ](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/) and use it with the Web3Auth
SDK.
