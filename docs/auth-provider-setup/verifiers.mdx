A verifier is essentially a configuration that contains information about the OAuth provider you've
chosen for your application. It acts as a bridge between Web3Auth and the OAuth provider, enabling
the Auth Network nodes to query and validate JWT tokens effectively.

A verifier contains the necessary information for Web3Auth's network nodes to validate the JWT token
provided by an authentication service. This process ensures that the login attempt is legitimate and
that the user controls the associated social or external account.

## Types of Verifiers

Web3Auth's design accommodates a variety of authentication scenarios through three primary verifier
types, each catering to different integration needs and offering distinct advantages:

### Default Verifiers

For the basic integration of Web3Auth Plug and Play, we shield you from the complexities of creating
and managing verifiers. This is done by providing default verifiers for the most popular social
login providers, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and more. These default verifiers are
pre-configured and ready to use, allowing you to get started with Web3Auth quickly and easily.

However, it is highly recommended to create custom verifiers for your application, as they offer
more flexibility and control over the authentication flow. Some other caveats of using default
verifiers are:

- **Migration from Default Verifiers to Custom Verifiers is not possible**: Once the keys are
  assigned for a particular verifier, they cannot be changed.
- **Aggregation of the default verifier is not possible**: If you want to aggregate two/more social
  providers, like Google and Email Passwordless, you will need to create an Aggregate Verifier,
  which is not possible if you start with:
  - a Default Verifier
  - Social Login Providers
  - Custom Providers

### Social Login Verifiers

These verifiers simplify the integration of popular social login options - Google, Facebook,
Discord, Twitch, and through Auth0, an array of additional services. This straightforward approach
is especially beneficial for applications employing an implicit login flow, ensuring a hassle-free
setup for both developers and users. Head over to the particular documentation for the social login
provider you want to integrate with Web3Auth.

### Custom Verifiers

For those seeking greater control or needing to integrate authentication services not directly
supported within Web3Auth's dashboard, custom verifiers offer a solution. Whether you're leveraging
your own backend authentication system or connecting to various social login providers, custom
verifiers provide the flexibility to manually configure your authentication flow. This setup is
particularly useful for applications integrating federated identity providers like Firebase,
Cognito, or Okta, allowing for a tailored authentication experience.

### Aggregate Verifiers

The digital landscape often requires users to authenticate via multiple methods. However, with
multiple providers, you'll need to create multiple verifiers. However, the
[wallet generated for each user is specific to a verifier](/troubleshooting/different-private-key#verifier).

Aggregate verifiers address this need by enabling a unified identity across different login
mechanisms. For instance, combining Google and Email Passwordless logins under a single verifier
ensure that users receive the same private key regardless of their chosen method. These login
methods should share the same verifier identifier, e.g., email or username which is unique to the
user.

This process involves creating an aggregate verifier, followed by sub-verifiers for each login
method.

:::tip

- It is advisable to create an `Aggregate Multiple Providers` verifier even if you're using just one
  login method for now. This will help you in the future if you want to add more login methods to
  use the [**Aggregate Verifier**](/auth-provider-setup/aggregate-verifier) feature of Web3Auth in
  your application.
- This is because we can't migrate from a single verifier(Social/Custom login methods) to an
  aggregate verifier without changing the wallet addresses.

## Create Verifier

The `Custom Authentication` tab of a project looks something like this:

![Custom Authentication Dashboard](/images/dashboard/custom-authentication.png)

Once you click on the `Create Verifier` button, you'll see a page similar to this:

![Verifier Modal on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/dashboard/create-verifier.png)

To create a verifier, you need to input the following details:

### Verifier identifier

The name of your verifier. This is a unique identifier that will be used to initialize the
`Web3Auth` SDKs for using the custom authentication feature.

### Choose a Login Provider

Select the Login Provider from the provided options.

The following is the list we have on our Dashboard:

1. Social Login Providers
   - [Google](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/google)
   - [Facebook](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/facebook)
   - [Twitch](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/twitch)
   - [Discord](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/discord)
   - [Auth0](/auth-provider-setup/authentication-service-providers/auth0-service-provider)
2. Custom Providers
   - [Custom JWT](/auth-provider-setup/byo-jwt-provider)
3. Aggregate Multiple Providers
   - [Aggregate Verifier](/auth-provider-setup/aggregate-verifier)

If something you're looking for is not available in the list, choose `Custom Provider` and provide
the JWT details.

:::note Can XYZ authenticator/login be supported?

The list above is only comprehensive to some of the logins our system can support. If you'd like
support for a particular login system, send your query to hello@web3auth.io or create a post under
`Feature Requests` on our [**Community Forum**](https://web3auth.io/community/c/feature-request/14).

:::

If you have created a verifier under your project, you'll see it under the custom authentication
tab.

## Edit Verifier

Click on the verifier or the three dots next to the verifier you wish to edit and click on
`Edit Verifier` in the dropdown.

![Verifier Options](/images/dashboard/edit-verifier.png)

The `Edit Verifier` page will appear with previously filled information. Make the necessary changes
and click on the `Update Verifier` button on the bottom.
