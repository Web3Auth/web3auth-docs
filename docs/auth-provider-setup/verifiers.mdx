### What is a Verifier?

A verifier is a piece of information about the OAuth provider being used by the application, which is queried by web3auth auth network nodes from a
smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to verify the JWT token.

**There are two types of `Verifiers` at Web3Auth:**

1. **`Default Verifiers`**: These are the verifiers associated with OAuth providers(Google, Facebook, Apple etc.) which are owned and managed by
   Web3Auth's account and **_migration from default verifiers to custom verifiers is not possible._**
2. **`Custom Verifiers`**: If you want to manage your OAuth providers(Google, Facebook, Apple etc.) yourself or to use some Federated Identity
   Providers like Auth0, Firebase, AWS Cognito, Okta etc., or even your Custom JWT Authentication, you'll need to create a verifier under a project on
   the Web3Auth's dashboard. `Social Login`, `Custom` or `Aggregate Multiple Providers` are the types of verifiers you can create on
   [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/).

**For users to be able to log in using a custom authentication flow, you will need to use a _Custom Verifier_.
[The wallet generated for each user is specific to a verifier.](/troubleshooting/different-private-key#verifier)**

:::tip

- It is advisable to create an `Aggregate Multiple Providers` verifier even if you're using just one login method for now. This will help you in the
  future if you want to add more login methods to use the [**Aggregate Verifier**](/auth-provider-setup/aggregate-verifier) feature of Web3Auth in
  your application.
- This is because we can't migrate from a single verifier(Social/Custom login methods) to an aggregate verifier without changing the wallet addresses.

You can read more about verifiers [in this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/Web3Auth/discussions/427#discussioncomment-3442052).

The `Custom Authentication` tab of a project looks something like this:

![Custom Authentication Dashboard](/images/dashboard/custom-authentication.png)

## Create Verifier

Once you click on the `Create Verifier` button, you'll see a page similar to this:

![Verifier Modal on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/dashboard/create-verifier.png)

To create a verifier, you need to input the following details:

### Verifier identifier

The name of your verifier. This is a unique identifier that will be used to initialize the `Web3Auth` SDKs for using the custom authentication
feature.

### Choose a Login Provider

Select the Login Provider from the provided options.

The following is the list we have on our Dashboard:

1. Social Login Providers
   - [Google](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/google)
   - [Facebook](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/facebook)
   - [Twitch](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/twitch)
   - [Discord](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/discord)
   - [Auth0](/auth-provider-setup/federated-identity-providers#auth0)
2. Custom Providers
   - [Custom JWT](/auth-provider-setup/byo-jwt-providers)
3. Aggregate Multiple Providers
   - [Aggregate Verifier](/auth-provider-setup/aggregate-verifier)

If something you're looking for is not available in the list, choose `Custom Provider` and provide the JWT details.

:::note Can XYZ authenticator/login be supported?

The list above is only comprehensive to some of the logins our system can support. If you'd like support for a particular login system, send your
query to hello@web3auth.io or create a post under `Feature Requests` on our [**Community Forum**](https://web3auth.io/community/c/feature-request/14).

:::

If you have created a verifier under your project, you'll see it under the custom authentication tab.

## Edit Verifier

Click on the verifier or the three dots next to the verifier you wish to edit and click on `Edit Verifier` in the dropdown.

![Verifier Options](/images/dashboard/edit-verifier.png)

The `Edit Verifier` page will appear with previously filled information. Make the necessary changes and click on the `Update Verifier` button at the
bottom.

## Aggregate Verifiers

Developers can create `Aggregate Multiple Provider` from the Web3Auth Dashboard by combining multiple login methods to create a verifier to get the
same address for their user regardless of their login providers. For example, combining a `Google` and `Email Passwordless` login or `Google` and
`GitHub` via Auth0 to access the same address for your user. These login methods should share the same Verifier ID, e.g., `email`; Such verifiers are
called `Single ID Verifiers`.

:::info Aggregate Verifier Set up

Check out the [**Aggregate Verifier page**](/auth-provider-setup/aggregate-verifier) to set up your aggregate verifier.
