Setting up authentication providers within Web3Auth is a crucial step in configuring the
authentication flow for your application. This process involves creating a verifier, a unique
identifier that Web3Auth uses to interact with the OAuth provider and validate user authentication
requests. Verifiers play a pivotal role in ensuring secure and seamless authentication by leveraging
the Web3Auth Auth Network nodes and a dedicated blockchain.

## Understanding Verifiers

A verifier is essentially a configuration that contains information about the OAuth provider you've
chosen for your application. It acts as a bridge between Web3Auth and the OAuth provider, enabling
the Auth Network nodes to query and validate JWT tokens effectively.

Head over to the [Verifiers](./verifiers.mdx) section to understand how to create a custom verifier
for your application.

## Setting Up Your Auth Provider

Integrating an OAuth provider with Web3Auth involves a few key steps, from selecting your provider
to configuring the verifier and integrating it into your application. Here's a broad overview of the
process:

1. **Select an OAuth Provider:** Choose an OAuth provider supported by Web3Auth, such as Google,
   Facebook, Twitter, or any other provider that fits your application's requirements.

2. **Create a Verifier:** Using the Web3Auth Dashboard, create a new verifier for your selected
   OAuth provider. This involves specifying the provider details and any additional configuration
   required by the provider.

3. **Deploy to the Web3Auth Blockchain:** Once your verifier is configured, it's deployed to the
   Web3Auth blockchain. This deployment process registers your verifier, making it accessible to the
   Auth Network nodes for JWT token verification. This process generally takes around 5-10 minutes
   to complete.

4. **Integrate with Your Application:** Finally, integrate the verifier into your application's
   authentication flow. This typically involves utilizing Web3Auth SDKs and specifying the verifier
   details in your application's authentication setup.

## Supported Auth Providers

### Social

### Authentication Service Providers

Authentication Service Providers allow you to utilize certain implicit and authorization code
grants. You may also use social providers on top of Federated / Identity providers to pick other
social providers (for example, Twitter, Apple, GitHub, LinkedIn, WeChat, and so on) that we do not
natively support. It is important to note that you must register an app with the Authentication
Service Providers before proceeding.

The links below will help you set up the following authentication service providers:
