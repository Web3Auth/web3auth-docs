Torus has a range of providers to allow your users to purchase cryptocurrencies directly with credit card/wire transfer. Developers can either access this through presenting the "Topup" page below, or trigger the fiat-to-crypto providers directly from the API.

Its worth noting that as the fiat-to-Crypto landscape is a complex and regulated industry, each provider comes with their pros and cons. One the one hand, although Wyre \(at the time of writing\) has the lowest fees, it's processors require US based cards. One the other hand, Simplex topup serves the global market but it must be accessed directly through the Torus UI due to legal restrictions. Before choosing and integrating, it is worth exploring [which provider](https://medium.com/toruslabs/conduct-transactions-directly-with-integrated-fiat-on-ramp-providers-bbd52def103b) suits your users best.

Through these third-party providers, we currently support direct purchase of BTC, ETH, DAI, BNB and more.
