title: Deposit eth to arbitrum and withdraw eth from arbitrum
---

Up to this point , we have arbitrum wallet account generated using openlogin and an arbitrum
`bridgeInstance` initialized using wallets and pre deployed testnet bridge smart contract addresses.

Now we can make transactions using `token-bridge-sdk` sdk which provides a react hook `useArbTokenBridge`
using which we can access methods that involve communicating between the L1 Ethereum chain
and the L2 Arbitrum chain (i.e., depositing and withdrawing assets) .

```js
   const bridge = useArbTokenBridge(
      bridgeInstance, false
   )

   // deposit
   const receipt = await bridge.eth.deposit("0.01");

    // withdraw
    const receipt = await bridge.eth.withdraw("0.01");
```
