title: Resume auth from redirect
---

In order for the SDK to receive and process auth result from redirect, in your
`App.swift` (or `AppDelegate.swift`), call `OpenLogin.resumeAuth` with the
redirect URL.

```swift
@main
struct MainApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView().onOpenURL { url in
                OpenLogin.resumeAuth(url)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
