title: Unlock zkSync wallet
---

To control assets in zkSync network, an account must register a separate public key once.

```js
  // As any other kind of transaction, `ChangePubKey` transaction requires fee.
  // User doesn't have (but can) to specify the fee amount. If omitted, library will query zkSync node for
  // the lowest possible amount.
  const changePubkey = await syncWallet.setSigningKey({ feeToken: 'ETH', ethAuthType: 'ECDSA' });

```
