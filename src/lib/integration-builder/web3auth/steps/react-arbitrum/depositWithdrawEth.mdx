title: Deposit eth to arbitrum and withdraw eth from arbitrum
---

Up to this point , we have arbitrum wallet account generated using openlogin and an arbitrum `bridgeInstance` initialized using wallets and pre
deployed testnet bridge smart contract addresses.

Now we can make transactions using `token-bridge-sdk` sdk which provides a react hook `useArbTokenBridge` using which we can access methods that
involve communicating between the L1 Ethereum chain and the L2 Arbitrum chain (i.e., depositing and withdrawing assets) .

```js
const bridge = useArbTokenBridge(bridgeInstance, false);

// deposit
const receipt = await bridge.eth.deposit("0.01");

// withdraw
const receipt = await bridge.eth.withdraw("0.01");
```
