title: Deposit eth to zkSync and withdraw eth from zkSync
---

Up to this point , we have zkSync wallet account generated using openlogin.

Now we can make transactions using zkSync sdk. We will demonstrate `deposit` and `withdraw` eth functionality.

We can deposit eth by using `syncWallet` which was generated after login with openlogin. Calling `depositToSyncFromEthereum` function of zkSync will
trigger a blockchain transaction so make sure you have sufficient eth to pay tx fee as well.

```js
const deposit = await syncWallet.depositToSyncFromEthereum({
  depositTo: syncWallet.address(),
  token: "ETH",
  amount: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.04"),
});
```

Similarly you can create a withdrawal request to withdraw eth from zkSync account back to ethereum.

```js
const withdraw = await syncWallet.withdrawFromSyncToEthereum({
  ethAddress: ethWallet.address,
  token: "ETH",
  amount: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.01"),
});
```
