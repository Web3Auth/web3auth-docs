title: Unlock zkSync wallet
---

To control assets in zkSync network, an account must register a separate public key once.

```js
// As any other kind of transaction, `ChangePubKey` transaction requires fee.
// User doesn't have (but can) to specify the fee amount. If omitted, library will query zkSync node for
// the lowest possible amount.
const changePubkey = await syncWallet.setSigningKey({ feeToken: "ETH", ethAuthType: "ECDSA" });
```
