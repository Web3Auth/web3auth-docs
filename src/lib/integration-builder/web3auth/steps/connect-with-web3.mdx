title: Connect with Web3/ethers.js
---

Integrating with OpenLogin gives you a provider and a private key, which can be wrapped by the Web3. This instance functions similar to Metamask's
Web3 provider and allows you to interact with Ethereum.

```js
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(openlogin.privKey, ethers.getDefaultProvider());
const address = await wallet.getAddress();
const balance = await wallet.getBalance();
```
