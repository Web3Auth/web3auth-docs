title: Get Solana secret key
---

After login, application will have access to user's openlogin private key but before using it with solana/web3.js, we just need to make this key
compatible with solana. `getED25519Key` function derives is Ed25519 key pair which is compatible with solana.

```js
const getSolanaPrivateKey = (openloginKey) => {
  const { sk } = getED25519Key(openloginKey);
  return sk;
};
```
