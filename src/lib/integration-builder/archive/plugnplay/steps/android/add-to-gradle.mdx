title: Add OpenLogin to Gradle
---

In your project-level `build.gradle` file, add JitPack repository:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Then, in your app-level `build.gradle` dependencies section, add the following:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation 'org.torusresearch:openlogin-android-sdk:-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

**Note**: This SDK is currently in beta, using `-SNAPSHOT` to make sure you receive latest updates and be aware that there may be breaking changes.
