title: Connect with Polygon (matic network)
---

We are using `@maticnetwork/meta/network` npm library to connect with matic network.

```js
const network = new Network(_network, _version);
console.log(network.Main.RPC, network.Matic.RPC);
const matic = new Matic({
  network: _network,
  version: _version,
  parentProvider: new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/73d0b3b9a4b2499da81c71a2b2a473a9"),
  maticProvider: new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(network.Matic.RPC),
});
await matic.initialize();
```
