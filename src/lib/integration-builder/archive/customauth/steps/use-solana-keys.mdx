title: Using Solana keys
---

Now that you have a Solana-compatible keypair, you can use it with [solana/web3.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js) to create a user
account and fetch user account's balance from the chain, do transaction, etc.

```js
const solanaAccountInfo = await solana.getAccountInfo(account.publicKey);
doSomething(solanaAccountInfo);
```
