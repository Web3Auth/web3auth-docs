Universal Links allow your users to intelligently follow links to content inside your app or to your website. Checkout
[Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/) for implementation.

```swift
func scene(_ scene: UIScene, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity) {
    guard userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb, let urlToOpen = userActivity.webpageURL else {
        return
    }
    TorusSwiftDirectSDK.handle(url: urlToOpen)
}
```
