title: Instantiate the SDK
---

Instantiate the SDK by creating an instance of class `DirectWebSdk` with your `baseUrl` of choice and one of our two networks `mainnet` or `testnet`:

```javascript
const torus = new DirectWebSdk({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000/auth",
  network: "testnet", // details for test net
});
await torus.init();
```

**Configure redirect URL at verifier's interface**:

At the verifier's interface (where you obtain client ID), add the `baseUrl` you provided here as a rediect URL.
