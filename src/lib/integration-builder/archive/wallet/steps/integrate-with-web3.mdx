title: Integrate with Web3/ether.js
---

Integrating with the Torus Wallet gives you a provider, which can be wrapped by the Web3. This instance functions similar to Metamask's Web3 provider.
We have taken great care to make it compatible with Metamask's Web3 interface.

```js
const web3 = new Web3(torus.provider);
```
