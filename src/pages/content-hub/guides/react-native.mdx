This guide will cover the basics of how to use the Web3Auth React Native SDK in your React Native application.

**Live Demo:** [Android](https://w3a.link/react-native-example) [iOS](https://w3a.link/react-native-ios-example)

Repository: https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/tree/main/react-native/rn-bare-quick-start

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/react-native/rn-bare-example w3a-rn-bare-demo && cd w3a-rn-bare-demo && npm install
```

```bash
# For Android
npm run android
# For iOS
cd ios && pod install && cd .. && npm run ios
```

## How it works?

When integrating Web3Auth React Native SDK with Social Login the flow looks something like this:

![Web3Auth Core - Social Login Flow](/images/implicit-flow.svg)

- When a user logs in with `Google`, Google sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for the user, in a self-custodial way, resulting in
  easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Prerequisites

<Web3AuthPrerequisites />

<RNBarePreRequisites />

## Setup

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

- Add `{YOUR_APP_SCHEME}://auth` in the **Whitelist URL** field of the Web3Auth Dashboard.

### Configure Deep Link

<Tabs
  defaultValue="android"
  values={[
    { label: "Android", value: "android" },
    { label: "iOS", value: "ios" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="android">

<RNAndroidConfig />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ios">

- Make sure that the minimum SDK compile version in `Podfile` is 14 or more.

```Podfile title="ios/Podfile"
platform :ios, '14'
```

- Install the Cocoa Pods within your project directory.

```shell
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

- In iOS, you don't need to add `redirectUrl` as an iOS Custom URL Scheme, however, you may add it to your `Info.plist`, but it is not required. Make
  sure your `redirectUrl` is registered in the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth to your project. To know more about the available
SDKs, please have a look at this [documentation page](/sdk).

For this guide, we will be talking through the [Web3Auth React Native SDK](/sdk/pnp/react-native).

### Installation

##### [`@web3auth/react-native-sdk`](https://github.com/web3auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/react-native-sdk
```

### Adding a Web Browser Module

We will also require a `WebBrowser` implementation to allow our JS-based SDK to interact with the native APIs, and different extra installation steps
depending on whether you are using the bare workflow or managed workflow. Since we're using the SDK with a bare workflow React Native app, you have to
install a `WebBrowser` implementation made by us as a port from the Expo Web Browser Module.

##### [`@toruslabs/react-native-web-browser`](https://github.com/torusresearch/react-native-web-browser)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @toruslabs/react-native-web-browser
```

### Adding an `EncryptedStorage` Module

We will also require an `EncryptedStorage` implementation to allow for session management without storing the private key on the device.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save react-native-encrypted-storage
```

### Initialization

After Installation, the next step to use Web3Auth is to Initialize the SDK. The Initialization is a two-step process,

- [Importing Required Packages](#importing-required-packages)
- [Instantiating Web3Auth](#instantiating-web3auth)

Please note that these are the most critical steps where you need to pass on different parameters according to the preference of your project.
Additionally, Whitelabeling and Custom Authentication have to be configured within this step, if you wish to customize your Web3Auth Instance.

#### Importing `Web3Auth`

You may also import additional types from the SDK to help in the development process.

```typescript
import Web3Auth, { LOGIN_PROVIDER, OPENLOGIN_NETWORK } from "@web3auth/react-native-sdk";
```

#### Importing a `WebBrowser` implementation

```typescript
import * as WebBrowser from "@toruslabs/react-native-web-browser";
```

#### Importing a `EncryptedStorage` implementation

```typescript
import EncryptedStorage from "react-native-encrypted-storage";
```

#### Instantiating Web3Auth

It's time to create an instance of Web3Auth in the project.

We need `clientId` and target Web3Auth `network` to initialize the `web3auth` object.

- You can get your `clientId` from registering (above) on the Developer Dashboard.

- `network` signifies the network on which the deployed Web3Auth nodes are running. For testing purposes, we have a `Sapphire Devnet` network. For
  production usage, you can use the `Sapphire Mainnet` network.

```tsx
const web3auth = new Web3Auth(WebBrowser, EncryptedStorage, {
  clientId,
  network: OPENLOGIN_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET, // SAPPHIRE_MAINNET or SAPPHIRE_DEVNET
});
```

:::tip SDK Reference

### Authentication

#### Logging in

Once initialized, you can use the `login` function of `web3auth` to navigate the user to the login process. For each login method, you have to select
the `loginProvider` such as `google`, `facebook`, `twitch`, `jwt`, `email_passwordless` etc.

:::info JWT

If you are using custom authentication through **Auth0 or Custom JWT**, you have to use the `JWT` login provider.

Additionally, in `extraLoginOptions` you have to provide the details required by that specific method as mentioned here.

:::

Once a user logs in, the user can access the key by `web3auth.privKey()`. For EVM Blockchains, the `secp256k1` private key is used to sign
transactions. We can get an `ed25519` compatible private key for other blockchains using `web3auth.ed25519Key()`.

```tsx
await web3auth.login({
  redirectUrl: resolvedRedirectUrl,
  mfaLevel: "default", // Pass on the MFA level of your choice: default, optional, mandatory, none
  loginProvider: "google", // Pass on the login provider of your choice: google, facebook, discord, twitch, twitter, github, linkedin, apple, etc.
});
```

:::info SDK Reference

If you wish you **[add Multi Factor Authentication](/sdk/pnp/react-native/mfa)**, **[use dApp Share](/sdk/pnp/react-native/dapp-share)** or
**[select Curve](/sdk/pnp/react-native/usage#selecting-curve)** for your React Native application, read the linked documentation.

- [Using dApp Share](/sdk/pnp/react-native/dapp-share)
- [Selecting Curve](/sdk/pnp/react-native/usage#selecting-curve)

### Get the User Profile

```tsx
// Assuming the user is logged in, get the user profile from the web3auth object
var userInfo = web3auth.userInfo();
```

Using the `web3Auth.login()` function, you can get the details of the logged-in user. Please note that these details are not stored anywhere in
Web3Auth network.

#### Sample userInfo

<ReactNativeResponse />

### Logout

Use the `logout` function of `web3auth` to log the user out.

```tsx
web3auth.logout();
```

:::info SDK Reference

- [`logout()` function](/sdk/pnp/react-native/usage#logout).

:::

## Interacting with the Blockchain

Once a user logs in, the user can access the private key by `web3auth.privKey()`. For EVM Blockchains, the `secp256k1` private key is used to sign
transactions. We can get an `ed25519` compatible private key for other blockchains using `web3auth.ed25519Key()`. Similar to how we're using this
private key in the `ethers.js` library in this example, you can connect to any other blockchain of your choice.

:::info connect any blockchain

Please go through the [Connect Blockchain](/connect-blockchain/evm/ethereum/react-native) Documentation, which contains all the details of the
EVM-based blockchain you have selected here.
