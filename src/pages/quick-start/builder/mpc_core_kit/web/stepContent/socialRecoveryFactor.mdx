title: Add a Social Recovery Factor [Optional]
---

Within the enable MFA function, we're adding a social recovery factor to the user's account. This is
an optional step and can be skipped if you don't want to enable MFA for the user.

To achieve this, we're just using Web3Auth's Single Factor Auth SDK to generate a private key for
the user with an OAuth of choice. This private key is then used as a factor key to be associated
with the TSS Share of the user for recovery.

:::tip

You can also associate this factor key with any other MFA setups like SMS OTP, Passkeys etc. by
encrypting the factor key with the user's unique identity from these recovery methods. This gives
you access to traditional MFA methods while still keeping the keys self-custodial for the user.
