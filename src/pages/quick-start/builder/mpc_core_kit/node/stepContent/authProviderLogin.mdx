title: Trigger Login using your Auth Provider
---

Before you fetch your provider from Web3Auth, you need to trigger a login using your Auth Provider.
Your Auth Provider, on a successful authentication will return an ID Token, which will be passed to
Web3Auth.

:::info

In this example, we're using a self created JWT ID Token. Web3Auth supports any OAuth2.0 compliant
authentication service, we have documented a few of the most common ones
[here](/auth-provider-setup/).
