title: Logging in your User
---

Use the `loginWithJWT` function in the Web3Auth Instance to login the user. After you have done the
authentication from your Auth Provider, just pass over the ID Token received by the Auth Provider to
the `loginWithJWT` function, alongside your verifier details.

After a successful user login, the `loginWithJWT` function returns a provider that can be used to
interact with the blockchain and sign transactions.

:::info SDK Reference

If you prefer an Implicit Flow for authentication, you alternatively use the `loginWithOauth`
function to login the user. This function will handle the authentication flow for you, however needs
some additional configurations.
