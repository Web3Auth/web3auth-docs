title: Enable MFA for the User [Optional]
---

One of the core functionalities of Web3Auth MPC Core Kit is to enable MFA and make the keys
self-custodial for the user. This is an optional step and can be skipped if you don't want to enable
MFA for the user.

This can be done easily by calling the `enableMFA` function, which stores a device share in the
browser's local storage and takes in a backup factor key to be associated with the user's recovery.
In this example, we have associated the social backup factor key with the user's recovery.
