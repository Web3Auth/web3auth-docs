title: Logging in your User
---

Use the `connectTo` function in the Web3Auth Instance to login the user. Just create a button that triggers the `connectTo` for the user, for the
login method of their choice.

After a successful user login, the `connectTo` function returns a provider that can be used to interact with the blockchain and sign transactions.
