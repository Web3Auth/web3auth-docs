title: Making Blockchain Calls
---

While using the Web3Auth Unity SDK, you get the private key within the user scope. This means that you can use it with any blockchain with their
corresponding library within the Unity environment.

:::tip Reference

Have a look at our [Connect Blockchain](/connect-blockchain/) section of the documentation and choose your blockchain to get started.

In this example, we are using the [Nethereum](https://nethereum.com/) library to make calls to the Ethereum blockchain. You can check out our
[Ethereum in Unity](/connect-blockchain/evm/ethereum/unity) guide of the documentation to get started.
