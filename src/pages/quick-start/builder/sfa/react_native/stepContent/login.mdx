title: Logging in your User
---

Use the `login` function in the Web3Auth Instance to log in the user. Just create a button that
triggers the `login` for the user of the login method of their choice.

Using the information provided by your auth provider, within the id token, after verification,
web3auth will return a provider which can be used for making blockchain calls.
