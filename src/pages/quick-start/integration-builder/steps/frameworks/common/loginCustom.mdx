title: Logging in your User
---

Use the `connectTo` function of `web3auth` to display the modal, while customising the logins of your choice. Here, the user can log in with the
logins that you've exposed using your custom authentication service.

You can pass on the jwt token from your authentication service directly into the `id_token` field, enabling a user to login into your backend service
and seemlessly access your web3 application by generating a private key through Web3Auth SDK which sits in the frontend context.

Know the additional parameters you can pass on to the **[`connectTo()` function](https://docs.web3auth.io/api-reference/web/customauth)**.

After a successful user login, the `web3auth` function will return a provider which will be used to interact with the blockchain and sign
transactions. The app scoped private key can also be accessed from the provider.
