title: Whitelabeling
---

Web3Auth is fully whitelabelable with application branding to have a consistent user experience. You can pass your Whitelabeling params in Web3Auth
constructor as well as while configuring `OpenloginAdapter` (see the step, **Configuring the OpenloginAdapter**).

Additionally, you can change the visibility and order of methods appearing in Web3Auth modal by passing config in `initParams`.

For more info on Whitelabeling refer to this [section](/developing-with-web3auth/whitelabeling).
