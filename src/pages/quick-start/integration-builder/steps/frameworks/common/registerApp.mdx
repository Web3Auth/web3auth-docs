title: Register your application
---

In order to use Web3Auth, you'll need to create a project in the [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) and get your `clientId`. This
`clientId` is required for instantiating the SDK and registering your application. You can also enable interoperability options within the project
while initialising it.

> This is not required on localhost enviroment, however, we recommend creating a `testnet` project in the dashboard for testing purposes in a hosted
> demo applicaiton. While moving to a production environment, make sure to convert your project to `mainnet` or `cyan`, otherwise you'll end up losing
> users and keys.
