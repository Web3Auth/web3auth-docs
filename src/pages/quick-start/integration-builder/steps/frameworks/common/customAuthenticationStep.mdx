title: Custom Authentication
---

Custom Authentication is a way to authenticate users with your own custom authentication service like Auth0, Firebase Authentication etc.

For enabling this, you need [Create a Verifier](/customauth/verifiers) from the **Custom Auth** section of the
[Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/home/customauth) with your desired configuration. You can then configure your
`OpenloginAdapter` with the `loginConfig` parameter. Additionally, you can configure the `connectTo` function while logging in the user with the
`loginProvider` & `extraLoginOptions` parameters.

For more info on Custom Authentication refer to this [section](/customauth/).
