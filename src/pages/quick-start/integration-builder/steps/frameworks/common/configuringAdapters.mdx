title: Configuring Adapters
---

While using Custom authentication or Custom Login UI, you need to configure the list of adapters that you want to use.

Here we are only configuring `OpenloginAdapter` adapter for using social logins.

Note that it requires you to pass the clientId which you can get from [web3auth dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).
