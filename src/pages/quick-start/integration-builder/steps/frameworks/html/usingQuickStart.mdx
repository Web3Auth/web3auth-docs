Quick starts are an easy way for you to get started while developing with Web3Auth. These are working sample applications built on top of your

To use it, you can either study the steps and the different snippets of code and them to your application, or simply copy paste the entire files and
run them on your own. If you face any problem anytime, you can always refer to the
[file an issue](https://github.com/Web3Auth/Web3Auth/issues/new/choose) for us to help you out as soon as possible!
