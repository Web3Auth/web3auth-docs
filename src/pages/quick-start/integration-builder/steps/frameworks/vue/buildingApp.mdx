To build this project locally, go through the following steps:

Create a new react project using the following command:

```shell
vue create hello-world
```

In the terminal menu, select the option `Manually select features` and select `Typescript` from the menu. Use Vue `3.x` as the version and keep
everything else as default.

> Further, replace the contents of the `src/` folder with the files of same name mentioned in the Quick Start.
