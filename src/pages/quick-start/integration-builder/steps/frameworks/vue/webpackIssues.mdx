title: Fixing Webpack 5 Issues
---

While using Vue CLI, you may run into issues building. This is because NodeJS polyfills are not included in the latest version of webpack 5. To solve
this, please have a look at this [troubleshooting page](https://docs.web3auth.io/troubleshooting/webpack-issues) where we have added the resolution.

For a quick fix here,

- Add the `vue.config.js` file to the root folder.

- Replace the file `package.json` in the root folder.
