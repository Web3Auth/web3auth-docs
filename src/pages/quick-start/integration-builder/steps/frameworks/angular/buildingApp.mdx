import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

To use this Angular Quick Start Guide, you can either study the steps and the different snippets of code and add them to your application, or simply
copy paste the entire files and run them on your own.

If you face any problem anytime, you can always refer to the [file an issue](https://github.com/Web3Auth/Web3Auth/issues/new/choose) for us to help

**To build this project locally, go through the following steps:**

Create a new angular project using the following command:

```shell
ng new angular-web3auth-example
```

> Further, replace the contents of the `src/app/` folder with the files of same name mentioned in the Quick Start.
