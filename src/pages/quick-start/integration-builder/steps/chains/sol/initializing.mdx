title: Using a provider with Solana
---

We can sign transactions and make rpc calls to connected chain by using provider available on web3auth instance once user is logged in. Refer to
documentation about providers to know more about the rpc calls available on provider for each chainNamespace.

There are two ways of calling rpc calls with provider, either you can directly use provider's request method to trigger rpc calls or you can also use
the SolanaWallet class from @web3auth/solana-provider package to use provider with. This class is a typed wrapper over provider which we get after
logging in with web3auth.

In this example we are using SolanaWallet wrapper to sign a transaction with connected web3 adapter.
