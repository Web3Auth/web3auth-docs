title: Getting StarkNet Keys
---

After login, application will have access to the user's private key Web3Auth provider. We cannot use this key with starknet ec curve specific signing
functions, so we need to derive starknet compatible keys from Web3Auth.

In the code snippet below getStarkAccount function creates a HD account from web3auth's key. It will return hex encoded private key and uncompressed
stark public key.

You can pass account index to derive multiple keys deterministically from single web3auth's key. We can generate starkKey from this and use on
StarkNet transactions.
