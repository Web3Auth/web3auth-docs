#### Setting up your base project for using Web3 libraries:

If you are starting from scratch, to set up this project locally, you will need to create a base Web application, where you can install the required
dependencies. However, while working with Web3, there are a few base libraries, which need additional configuration. This is because certain packages
are not available in the browser environment, and we need to polyfill them manually. You can follow
[this documentation](/troubleshooting/webpack-issues) where we have mentioned the configuration changes for some popular frameworks for your
reference.
