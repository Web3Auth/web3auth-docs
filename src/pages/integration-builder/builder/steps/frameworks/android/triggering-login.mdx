title: Triggering the login
---

Call the `login()` method on the `Web3Auth` instance to trigger the login flow. You should pass the `loginProvider` parameter to specify the provider
you wish to use.

If you are using the `email_passwordless` login provider, you will also have to specify the email address as `login_hint` in the `extraLoginOptions`
as well.
