For making hybrid iOS & Android applications using React Native, we have the
[web3auth-react-native-sdk](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk) to integrate Web3Auth into your application.

---

First, install the React Native SDK via npm or yarn.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/react-native-sdk
```
