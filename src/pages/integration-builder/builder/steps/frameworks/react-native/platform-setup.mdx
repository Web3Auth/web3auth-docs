Add the your desired url redirect scheme into `app.json` of your Expo project.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bare">

** Android **

- For Android, the redirectUrl parameter is specificable, and has to be added into the AndroidManifest.xml.

** iOS **

- For iOS, the redirectUrl parameter is also specificable, and does not need to be added as a iOS Custom URL Scheme. However you can still add it to
  the `Info.plist` if you want to do so, but it is not required.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
