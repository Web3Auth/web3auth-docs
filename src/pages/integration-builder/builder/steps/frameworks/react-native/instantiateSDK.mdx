title: Create and initialize the Web3Auth instance
---

Lets now create an instance of the `Web3Auth`.

We need `clientId` and `network` to initialize `Web3Auth` class. You can get your `clientId` from registering (above), whereas `network` signifies the
type of chain you want to initialize web3auth with.

If you want to use Whitelabel or Custom Authentication, you will also have to specify it in the constructor as well.
