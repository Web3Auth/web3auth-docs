Web3Auth can be configured with applications branding to have a consistent user experience. You can pass your Whitelabeling params in Web3Auth
constructor as well as while configuring `Openlogin` adapter.

Also you can change the visibility and order of methods appearing in Web3Auth modal by passing config in initParams.
