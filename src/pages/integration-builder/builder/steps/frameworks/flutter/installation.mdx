For making hybrid iOS & Android applications using Flutter, we have the [web3auth-flutter-sdk](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-flutter-sdk) to
integrate Web3Auth into your application.

Android API version 21 or newer.

---

Add `web3auth_flutter` as a dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  web3auth_flutter:
    git: https://github.com/torusresearch/web3auth-flutter-sdk.git
```

### Android

- Perform the native [Android integration steps](/api-reference/android/setting-up).
- For Android, the redirectUrl parameter is specificable, and has to be added into the AndroidManifest.xml.

### iOS

- Perform the native [iOS integration steps](/api-reference/ios/setting-up).

- For iOS, the redirectUrl parameter is fixed, which is `\(bundleId)://auth`, and does not need to be added as a iOS Custom URL Scheme.
