title: Fixing Webpack 5 Issues
---

While using Angular CLI, you may run into issues building. This is because NodeJS polyfills are not included in the latest version of webpack 5. To
solve this, please have a look at this [troubleshooting page](https://docs.web3auth.io/troubleshooting/webpack-issues) where we have added the
resolution.

For a quick fix here,

- Replace the files `package.json` & `tsconfig.json` in the root folder.

- Replace the file `polyfills.js` in the `src/` folder.
