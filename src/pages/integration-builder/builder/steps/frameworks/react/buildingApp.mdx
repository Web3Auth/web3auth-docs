title: Using Web3Auth React Quick Start Guide
---

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

To use this React Quick Start Guide, you can either study the steps and the different snippets of code and add them to your application, or simply
copy paste the entire files and run them on your own.

If you face any problem anytime, you can always refer to the [Web3Auth Discussions Page](https://github.com/Web3Auth/Web3Auth/discussions) for us to
help you out as soon as possible!

**To build this project locally, go through the following steps:**

Create a new react project using the following command:

<Tabs
defaultValue="npx"
values={[
  { label: "npx", value: "npx" },
  { label: "Yarn", value: "yarn" },
]}
>
<TabItem value="npx">

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

  </TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

> Further, replace the contents of the `src/` folder with the files of same name mentioned in the Quick Start.

**Run the app using**

```shell
npm start
```
