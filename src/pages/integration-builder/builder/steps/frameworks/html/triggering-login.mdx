title: Triggering the login
---

Use the `connect` function of `web3AuthInstance` to display modal, events will trigger on the user's interaction with the SDK.

After a successful user login, the web3auth instance will expose a provider under `web3AuthInstance.provider` which we will use to interact with
blockchains and sign transactions. The key can also be accessed from the provider.
