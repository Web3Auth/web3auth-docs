title: Create the Web3Auth instance
---

It's time to create an instance of the `Web3Auth` in the project.

We need `clientId` and `chainNamespace` to initialize web3auth class. You can get your `clientId` from registering (above), whereas `chainNamespace`
signifies the type of chain you want to initialize web3auth with, which will depend on the blockchain you've selected here. Please go through the
[connect blockchain](/connect-blockchain/) documentation, which contains all the details of the respective blockchain you have selected here.

For customising the UI for your project, you can pass on the `uiConfig` parameter to the `Web3Auth` constructor. Know more about
[Whitelabeling Web3Auth](/whitelabeling)

> There might be cases you will be getting an JSON-RPC error, which comes from the overloading of the test node server mentioned in this example. In
> that case, we recommend you to pass on your own node server in the `rpcTarget` value, which can be easily created by using a service like
> [Infura](https://infura.io/), [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/) etc.

> Additionally, there are multiple other parameters, mentioned in our [SDK Reference](/sdk/web/web3auth/initialize#instantiating-web3auth)
