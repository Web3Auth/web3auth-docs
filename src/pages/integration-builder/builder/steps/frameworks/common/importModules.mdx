title: Import the Web3Auth Modules into your project
---

**`@web3auth/web3auth`**

This is the main Plug and Play package that contains the Web3Auth SDK with a login UI, giving you a simple way of implementing Web3Auth within your
interface.

**`@web3auth/base`**

Since we're using typescript, we need the base package to provide types of the different variables we'll be using throughout the app building process.
This reduces errors to a very large extent.

> Additionally, import the RPC file for your selected blockchain.
