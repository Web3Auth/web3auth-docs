title: Interacting with the StarkNet Layer 2
---

Once a user logs in, the Web3Auth SDK returns a provider. Even though StarkNet is a layer 2 on Ethereum, it is not EVM compatible. Hence to use it,
one cannot use the native `EIP1193` provider that Web3Auth gives for EVM blockchains. Hence we need to directly use the private key to make the calls
here.

Using the function, `web3auth.provider.request({method: "private_key"})` from Web3Auth provider, the application can have access to the user's private
key. However, we cannot use this key with StarkNet EC Curve specific signing functions, hence, we first derive the Stark Key using the `getStarkKey()`
function.

On the underhood, it uses the `starkwareCrypto.ec.keyFromPrivate()` function, where we pass our Private key with the `hex` argument, since it is hex
encoded. Further we get the public key from this using the `starkwareCrypto.ec.keyFromPublic()` function, and we take its X-coordinate using
`.pub.getX()` which is our `starkKey`. We use this `starkKey` on StarkNet transactions.

For the `deployAccount()`, we use the file `ArgentAccount.json` which given us the ABI of the compiled contract. We use that contract in starknet's
`defaultProvider.deployContract()` function to deploy the contract.
