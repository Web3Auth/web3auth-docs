title: Interacting with the Solana Blockchain
---

Once a user logs in, the Web3Auth SDK returns a provider. Using this provider we can sign transactions and make RPC calls to Solana.

Refer to [solana provider documentation](https://docs.web3auth.io/api-reference/web/providers/solana) to know more about how to use the provider to
make calls on the Solana blockchain.

There are two ways of calling RPC calls with provider:

1.  You can directly use provider's request method to trigger RPC calls
2.  You can use the SolanaWallet class from `@web3auth/solana-provider` package to use provider with. This class is a typed wrapper over provider
    which we get after logging in with web3auth.

In this example we are using SolanaWallet wrapper to sign a transaction with connected web3 adapter.
