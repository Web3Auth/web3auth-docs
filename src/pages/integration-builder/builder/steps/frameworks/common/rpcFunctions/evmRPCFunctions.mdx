title: Interacting with an EVM Compatible Blockchain
---

Once a user logs in, the Web3Auth SDK returns a provider. Using this provider we can sign transactions and make RPC calls to any EVM Blockchain.

Refer to the [EIP1193 Provider Documentation](https://docs.web3auth.io/api-reference/web/providers/evm) to know more about how to use the provider to
make calls on any EVM blockchain.

This example initailizes `Web3` library. You can do similar calls with `Ethers.js` as well.
