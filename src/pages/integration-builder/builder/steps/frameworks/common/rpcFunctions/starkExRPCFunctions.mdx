title: Interacting with the StarkEx Layer 2
---

Once a user logs in, the Web3Auth SDK returns a provider. Even though StarkEx is a layer 2 on Ethereum, it is not EVM compatible. Hence to use it, one
cannot use the native `EIP1193` provider that Web3Auth gives for EVM blockchains. Hence we need to directly use the private key to make the calls
here.

Using the function, `web3auth.provider.request({method: "private_key"})` from Web3Auth provider, the application can have access to the user's private
key. However, we cannot use this key with StarkEx EC Curve specific signing functions, hence, we first derive the Stark Key using the `getStarkKey()`
function.

On the underhood, it uses the `getStarkAccount()` function, which creates an account from web3auth's key. It will return a `hex` encoded private key
and uncompressed public starkKey. We can generate starkKey from this and use on StarkEx transactions.
