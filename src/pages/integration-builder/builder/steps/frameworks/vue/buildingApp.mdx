---

To use this Vue Quick Start Guide, you can either study the steps and the different snippets of code and add them to your application, or simply copy
paste the entire files and run them on your own.

If you face any problem anytime, you can always refer to the [file an issue](https://github.com/Web3Auth/Web3Auth/issues/new/choose) for us to help
you out as soon as possible!

**To build this project locally, go through the following steps:**

Create a new vue project using the following command:

```shell
vue create hello-world
```

In the terminal menu, select the option `Manually select features` and select `Typescript` from the menu. Use Vue `3.x` as the version and keep
everything else as default.

> Further, replace the contents of the `src/` folder with the files of same name mentioned in the Quick Start.

**Run the app using**

```shell
npm run-script serve
```
