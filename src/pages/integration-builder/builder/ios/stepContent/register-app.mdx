In order to use Web3Auth, you'll need to create a project in the [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) and get your client ID.

- Go to [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/), create or select an Web3Auth project:

- Add `(bundleId)://auth` to **Whitelist URLs**.

- Now you can use this client ID in 2 ways:

  - In your application bundle add a plist file named `Web3Auth.plist` with the following information:

  - Or you can use the following code snippet whenever initializing Web3Auth, you need to pass in your client ID this way:

  ```swift
  import Web3Auth
  let web3auth = Web3Auth(
    W3AInitParams(
      clientId: "<your clientId>",
      network: .MAINNET,
      sdkUrl: ...,
      redirectUrl: ..., ))
  ```
