title: Multi Factor Authentication
---

The Multi Factor Authentication feature refers to the ability of the user to create a backup share (recovery phrase). This helps them login into a new
device and also to recover their account if they lose their original device.

You can set the `mfaLevel` within the `W3ALoginParams` to customize when mfa screen should be shown to user. It currently accepts 4 values: `default`,
`optional`, `mandatory` and `none`.
