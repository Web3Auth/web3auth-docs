title: Create and initialize the Web3Auth instance
---

Let's now create an instance of the `Web3Auth` class inside on file load.

We need `clientId` and `network` to initialize web3auth class. You can get your `clientId` from registering (above), whereas `network` signifies the
type of network(`MAINNET`, `TESTNET`, or `CYAN`) you want to initialize web3auth with.

Now, lets create an instance of the `Web3Auth` class. It can be initialized on-demand when the user interactions is input (like button click) or when
the screen is initialized.

If you choose to put your `clientId` and `network` in the `Web3Auth.plist` that is placed on the root of your app's bundle, you can initialize the SDK
with just the empty constructor. However, if you don't wish to use the `Web3Auth.plist` mechanism, you can also use the constructor that allows to use
dynamic parameter in code.

If you want to use Whitelabel or Custom Authentication, you will also have to specify it in the dynamic paramter constructor as well, and the
`Web3Auth.plist` approach cannot be used.
