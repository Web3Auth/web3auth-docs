title: Create and initialize the Web3Auth instance
---

Lets now create an instance of the `Web3Auth`.

We need `clientId` and `network` to initialize web3auth class. You can get your `clientId` from registering (above), whereas `network` signifies the
type of network(`MAINNET`, `TESTNET`, `CYAN`, `AQUA`, or `CELESTE`) you want to initialize web3auth with.

Now, lets create an instance of the `Web3Auth` class. It can be initialized on-demand when the user interactions is input (like button click) or when
the screen is initialized.

If you want to use Whitelabel or Custom Authentication, you will also have to specify it in the dynamic paramter constructor as well.
