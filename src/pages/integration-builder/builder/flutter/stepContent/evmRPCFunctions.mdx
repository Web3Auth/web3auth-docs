title: Interacting with an EVM Compatible Blockchain
---

While using the Web3Auth Flutter SDK, you get the private key within the user scope. This private key can interact with
[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) to make any blockchain calls, like getting user's `account`, fetch `balance`, `sign transaction`,
`send transaction`, `read` from and `write` to the smart contract, etc.

Refer to the [Blockchain Documentation](/docs/connect-blockchain/ethereum/flutter) to know more about how to make calls on any EVM blockchain.
