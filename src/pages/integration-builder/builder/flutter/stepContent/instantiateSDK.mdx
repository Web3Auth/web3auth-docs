title: Create and initialize the Web3Auth instance
---

Lets now create an instance of the `Web3AuthFlutter`.

We need `clientId` and `network` to initialize Web3AuthFlutter class. You can get your `clientId` from registering (above), whereas `network`
signifies the type of network(`mainnet`, `testnet`, `cyan`, `aqua`, or ) you want to initialize web3auth with.

If you want to use Whitelabel or Custom Authentication, you will also have to specify it in the dynamic paramter constructor as well.
