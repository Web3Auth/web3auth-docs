For making hybrid iOS & Android applications using Flutter, we have the [web3auth-flutter-sdk](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-flutter-sdk) to
integrate Web3Auth into your application.

---

Add `web3auth_flutter` as a dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  web3auth_flutter: ^1.0.3
```

or

```sh
flutter pub add web3auth_flutter
```

Checkout https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/flutter/ to configure for Android and iOS in your Flutter project. This is must, so please don't skip it.
