For making hybrid iOS & Android applications using Flutter, we have the [web3auth-flutter-sdk](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-flutter-sdk) to
integrate Web3Auth into your application.

**Requirements**

- Android API version `24` or newer.
- For Android build: compileSdkVersion needs to be `32`. Check `android/app/build.gradle` in your Flutter project to change it.
- iOS 12+
- Xcode 11.4+ / 12.x
- Swift 4.x / 5.x
- For iOS build: `platform :ios` needs to be `13.0`. Check `ios/Podfile` in your Flutter project to change it.

Add `web3auth_flutter` as a dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  web3auth_flutter: ^1.0.3
```

or

```sh
flutter pub add web3auth_flutter
```

Checkout https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/flutter/ to configure for Android and iOS in your Flutter project. This is must, so please don't skip it.
