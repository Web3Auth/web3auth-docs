title: Custom Authentication
---

Custom Authentication is a way to authenticate users with your own custom authentication service like Socials, Auth0, Firebase, Cognito and even your
own JWT token etc.

For enabling this, you need [Create a Verifier](/custom-authentication/verifiers) from the **Custom Auth** section of the
[Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) with your desired configuration. You can add the your configuration to the `loginConfig`
field of the `Web3AuthOptions` object.

> For more info on Custom Authentication refer to [this section](/docs/sdk/unity/custom-authentication).
