title: Logging in your User
---

Use the `connect` function in the Web3Auth Instance to display the modal. The modal will prompt the user to login with their wallet and handle the
authentication for you.

After a successful user login, the `connect` function returns a provider that can be used to interact with the blockchain and sign transactions.
