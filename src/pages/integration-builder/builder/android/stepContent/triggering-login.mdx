title: Triggering the login
---

Trigger login flow with the selected provider from the list of providers available under `com.web3auth.core.Web3Auth.Provider` such as `GOOGLE`,
`FACEBOOK`, `TWITTER`, `EMAIL_PASSWORDLESS`, etc. `web3Auth.login()` requires `LoginParams` as a required input.

:::info Email Passwordless

If you are using the `EMAIL_PASSWORDLESS` login provider, you will also have to specify the email address as `login_hint` in the `extraLoginOptions`.

```kotlin
LoginParams(
    Provider.EMAIL_PASSWORDLESS,
    extraLoginOptions = ExtraLoginOptions(
        login_hint: "email@domain.com",
    )
)
```
