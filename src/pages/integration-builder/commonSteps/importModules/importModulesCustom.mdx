title: Import the Web3Auth Modules into your project
---

**[`@web3auth/modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/modal/)**

This is the main Plug and Play Modal package that contains the Web3Auth SDK with a login UI, giving you a simple way of implementing Web3Auth within
your interface.

**[`@web3auth/openlogin-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin)**

For using Custom Authentication & Whitelabeling, we need to use the OpenLogin Adapter, where we can initialise the authentication details and add
customisations in the login UI.

**`@web3auth/base`**

Since we're using typescript, we need the base package to provide types of the different variables we'll be using throughout the app building process.
This reduces errors to a very large extent.
