title: Custom Authentication
---

Custom Authentication is a way to authenticate users with your own custom authentication service like Auth0, Firebase Authentication etc.

For enabling this, you need [Create a Verifier](/custom-authentication/verifiers) from the **Custom Auth** section of the
[Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) with your desired configuration. You can then configure your `OpenloginAdapter` with the
`loginConfig` parameter.

Since we're using the `@web3auth/modal`, ie. the Plug and Play SDK, the `loginConfig` should be corresponding to the socials mentioned in the modal.
Here, we're customising `Google` and `Facebook` to be custom verified, rest all other socials will be default. You can customise other social logins
or remove them using the whitelabeling option.

Finally, if you do not want the modal to be shown and use Web3Auth just as a service, you can use our Core SDK, ie. `@web3auth/core`.
