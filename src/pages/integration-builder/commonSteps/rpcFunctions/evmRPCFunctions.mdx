title: Interacting with an EVM Compatible Blockchain
---

Once a user logs in, the Web3Auth SDK returns a provider. Using this provider we can sign transactions and make RPC calls to any EVM Blockchain.

Refer to the [EIP1193 Provider Documentation](https://docs.web3auth.io/sdk/web/providers/evm) to know more about how to use the provider to make calls
on any EVM blockchain.
