Web3Auth is fully whitelabelable with application branding to have a consistent user experience. You can pass your Whitelabeling params in Web3Auth
constructor as well as while configuring `OpenloginAdapter`, passing on the `whiteLabel` parameter.

Additionally, you can change the visibility and order of methods appearing in Web3Auth modal by passing config in `initModal` function, while
initialising the SDK.
