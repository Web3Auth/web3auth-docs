In this guide, we'll talk about how we can use Web3Auth Single Factor Auth with Firebase in your iOS
application.

As an overview, the guide is quite simple, with functionality to log in, display user details, and
perform blockchain interactions. The signing of the blockchain transactions is done through the
Web3Auth embedded wallet. You can check out the infrastructure docs,
["Web3Auth Wallet Management Infrastructure"](/docs/infrastructure) for a high-level overview of the
Web3Auth architecture and implementation. For those who want to skip straight to the code, you can
find it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-core-kit-examples/tree/main/single-factor-auth-ios/sfa-ios-quick-start).

## How to set up Web3Auth Dashboard

If you haven't already, sign up on the Web3Auth platform. It is free and gives you access to the
Web3Auth's base plan. After the basic setup, explore other features and functionalities offered by
the Web3Auth Dashboard. It includes custom verifiers, whitelabeling, analytics, and more. Head to
[Web3Auth's documentation](/docs/dashboard-setup) page for detailed instructions on setting up the
Web3Auth Dashboard.

## How to set up Firebase for iOS

If you haven't already setup the Firebase for your iOS app, please setup the Firebase, as it's the
prerequisites for the guide. Head to the
[Firebase's documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) for the details instructions.

## How to set up Custom verifier

Once, you have set up the Web3Auth Dashboard, created a new project, and set up Firebase, it's time
to create a Custom Verifier for your Firebase application. We already have detail instructions on
how to create a Custom Verifier for Firebase, please head to our
[documentation](https://web3auth.io/docs/auth-provider-setup/authentication-service-providers/firebase-service-provider).

## Integrating Web3Auth SFA in iOS

Once, you have set up the Custom Verifier, it's time to integrate Web3Auth in your iOS application.
For the implementation, we'll use the "single-factor-auth-swift". This SDK facilitates integration
with Web3Auth. This way you can easily manage embedded wallet in your iOS application.

### Installation

To install the single-factor-auth-swift package, you have two options. You can either use the Swift
Package Manager, or you can install using Cocoapods.

<Tabs defaultValue = "spm"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift Package Manager", value: "spm", },
    { label: "Cocoapods", value: "pods", },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="spm">

<SPM />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pods">

<Cocoapods />

</ TabItem>
</ Tabs>

### Initialization

After successfully installing the package, the next step is to initialize `SingleFactorAuth` in your
iOS app. This sets up the necessary configurations using Web3Auth network and prepares the SDK.
[Learn more about SingleFactorAuth Initialization](/docs/sdk/sfa/sfa-ios/initialize).

<Initialize />

### Session Management

To check whether the user is authenticated, you can use the `initialize` method. For a user already
authenticated, the result would be a non-nullable `SFAKey`. You can navigate to different views
based on the result.

<SessionManagement />

### Authentication

If the user is not authenticated, you should utilize the `connect` method. For the guide, we will
add Email Password login using Firebase. The `connect` method is pretty straightforward in
SingleFactorAuth and takes `LoginParams` as input. After successfully logging in, the method will
return the `SFAKey`.

Learn more about [SingleFactorAuth LoginParams](/docs/sdk/sfa/sfa-ios/usage#parameters). To more
about Firebase login methods, please
[checkout the Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/start).

```swift
do {
    // Replace email and password with user's email and password
    let res = try await Auth.auth().signIn(withEmail: "ios@firebase.com", password: "iOS@Web3Auth")
    let id_token = try await res.user.getIDToken()

    // Replace with the verifier you created in Web3Auth Dashboard
    // for your project.
    let verifierName = "w3a-firebase-demo"

    // focus-start
    let sfaKey = try await singleFactorAuth.connect(
        loginParams: .init(
            verifier: verifierName,
            verifierId: res.user.uid,
            idToken: id_token
        )
    )
    // focus-end
} catch {
    // Handle error
}
```

## Set up Blockchain Providers

Once we have successfully authenticated the user, the next step would be to fetch the user details,
retrieve wallet address and prepare blockchain providers for interactions. For this guide, we are
supporting only Ethereum ecosystem, but the general idea can be used for any blockchain ecosystem.

For interacting with ethereum chains, we'll use the
[web3.swift](https://github.com/argentlabs/web3.swift) package. To install the
single-factor-auth-swift package, you have two options. You can either use the Swift Package
Manager, or you can install using Cocoapods.

<Tabs defaultValue = "spm"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift Package Manager", value: "spm", },
    { label: "Cocoapods", value: "pods", },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="spm">

1. In Xcode, with your app project open, navigate to **File > Add Packages**.

2. When prompted, add the web3.swift package repository:

   ```sh
   https://github.com/argentlabs/web3.swift
   ```

   From the `Dependency Rule` dropdown, select `Exact Version` and enter `1.6.1` as the version.

3. When finished, Xcode will automatically begin resolving and downloading your dependencies in the
   background.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pods">
Add `web3.swift` as a dependency to your `Podfile`.

```sh
pod 'web3.swift', '~> 1.6.1'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After successfully installing package, it's time to create an extension for `SFAKey` which conforms
to `EthereumSingleKeyStorageProtocol`.

```swift
extension SFAKey: EthereumSingleKeyStorageProtocol {
    public func storePrivateKey(key: Data) throws {}

    public func loadPrivateKey() throws -> Data {
        guard let privKeyData = Data.init(hex: self.getPrivateKey()) else {
            return Data()
        }
        return privKeyData

    }
}
```

Once, we have created the extension, we will create `EthereumAccount` instance to retrive user's EOA
address, and sign the transactions.

```swift
let ethereumAccount = try! EthereumAccount(
  keyStorage: sfaKey as EthereumSingleKeyStorageProtocol
)

let address = ethereumAccount.address
```

To retrive user's balance, and interacting with Blockcahin, you can follow our detailed guide on how
to [interact with EVM chain guides](/docs/connect-blockchain/evm/ethereum/ios#get-balance). To
interact with Solana blockchain, you can checkout our
[Solana blockchain guide](/docs/connect-blockchain/solana/ios).
