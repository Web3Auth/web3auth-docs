This guide will help you make a react application using Web3Auth tKey MPC SDK, covering the basic
functionality on how to use it.

**Live Demo:** https://w3a.link/tkey-mpc-example

:::note

This is an advanced guide, meant for enterprise developers and contains multiple moving parts that
might be difficult to understand. Please contact our team if you're looking to integrate this SDK,
and we'll be happy to help you out.

For general integrations, [MPC Core Kit](/sdk/mpc-core-kit) is the best alternative to be used.

:::

## Prerequisites

- A basic knowledge of JavaScript and React.
- Ideal to have a knowledge about service workers in React.
- A [Google Developer](https://console.developers.google.com/) account to be used as Login provider
  for Web3Auth Custom Authentication.
- Create a Web3Auth account on the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/)

## Understanding the Web3Auth tKey JS MPC SDK

With the Web3Auth infrastructure, your key is divided into multiple parts and stored across your
devices and our Auth Network. This ensures that your key is always available and never stored in a
single place. While in the traditional Web3Auth SDK, your key was dynamically reconstructed in the
frontend using shamir secret sharing. With the new Web3Auth MPC (Multi Party Computation)
architecture, it is **never reconstructed**. Instead, these partial keys are stored across different
locations, and your device is used to make partial signatures for your message/ transaction. These
are finally returned to the frontend where using TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme), these signatures
are combined to make a final signature. You can use this finally signed message/transaction to make
a transaction on the blockchain.

The Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) is a cryptographic primitive for distributed key generation and
signing. The use of TSS in Web3Auth's Auth network is a new paradigm that can provide numerous
benefits, especially in terms of security.

  />
</picture>

As you can notice in this diagram above, the final output, i.e., the User's TSS Account, is
generated in multiple stages within the infrastructure. Since this is a TSS- MPC based
infrastructure, you don't get back a private key, but signatures that can be used to make
transactions on the blockchain. Let's understand each of these stages in detail.

### Factors

##### Social Login Factor

This is the primary way for a user to access their account. This step involves authentication using
a user's preferred social login provider. The idToken received from the social login provider here
is passed to the Web3Auth Auth Network to generate the TSS Shares in the Nodes. By default, these
nodes have a threshold of 3/5 that can be customized according to requirements. When a user logs in,
the Auth Network generates signatures corresponding to the TSS Shares in the nodes and returns them
to the user's end. These signatures are then used alongside other shares to generate the final TSS
Account signatures.

##### Device Factor

This is the second factor used to access the user's account. This step involves the generation of a
TSS Share on the user's device and using that to generate a final signature for the TSS Account
alongside the social login factor. This ensures the user logs in using their trusted device and
maintains a proper non-custodial setup.

##### Backup Factor

A user has a choice to generate as many backup factors as needed to access their account. This step
involves the generation of a TSS Share on the user's end and storing them in whichever location they
prefer. This share can be used similarly to the device share to generate a final signature for the
TSS Account alongside the social login and/or device factors.

### Threshold

The threshold is the minimum number of shares required to generate a final signature for the TSS
Account. This threshold, by default, is set to 3/5 on the Auth Network and 2/3 for the user's device
front. This ensures high availability and ease of access on both ends alongside optimum security.
Both these thresholds can be customized according to the requirements.

### Components of a Factor

#### TSS Shares

The TSS Shares are the main component needed for the generation of the final working signature of
the user. These shares are generated using distributed key generation and are stored in the Auth
Network and the user's device. Since these shares are generated using MPC, they are **never
reconstructed** and always stay decentralized and secure.

#### Metadata Key & Shares

The Metadata Key closely mimics the storage of the TSS Key and Shares. The only difference is that
the metadata key is always reconstructed and used for its encryption/decryption capabilities. It
utilizes basic Shamir's Secret Sharing and is initially generated on a users' frontend. The metadata
key ensures that the infrastructure is backward compatible with the existing Web3Auth architecture,
which utilizes SSS (Shamir's Secret Sharing) as the main key reconstruction scheme.

#### Factor Keys

To enable refresh, deletion, and rotational capabilities on the `tssKey`, we also introduce
**factorKeys**. Factor Keys are randomly generated keys unique to each factor-generated user's
device and backups, like users' phones, chrome extension, on their cloud, assisting third parties,
etc.

As shares to the TSS Key and/or Metadata Key may rotate, Factor Keys allow a consistent secret to
being saved in these different locations.

For this guide, we will be talking through the Web3Auth tKey JS MPC SDK and showing you a basic
example of using it with `@tkey-mpc/default` package.

## Setup

### Setup your Google App

1. Follow Googleâ€™s instructions to
   [set up an OAuth 2.0 app.](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en)
2. Add your application's redirect URI into the "Authorized redirect URIs" field. This is the URL
   that Google will redirect to after authentication. `http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/redirect`

   ![Google OAuth2.0 App Dashboard](/guides/social-providers/google/google-app-redirect-uri.png)

3. Obtain the OAuth `Client ID` from your
   [App on the Google Developer dashboard](https://console.developers.google.com/)

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

- Create a **Verifier** from the **Custom Auth** Section of the
  [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) with following configuration:

  - Choose a name of your choice for the verifier identifier. `eg. google-tkey-w3a`
  - Select environment: Please note the verifier will be deployed on `sapphire_mainnet` or
    `sapphire_devnet` environment.
  - Select `Google` from the **Login Provider**.
    ![Google - Login Providers list on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/login-providers-list.png)
  - Paste the **Client ID** from the Google App(above) to the `Client ID` field.
    ![Google Client ID on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/google-verifier.png)
  - Click on `Create` button to create your verifier. It may take up to 10-20 minutes to deploy
    verifier on _testnet_. You'll receive an email once it's complete.

- You will require the `verifierName` of the newly created verifier.

### Setting up your React Project

We will need to use service workers while implementing the tKey SDK to handle the redirect login
flow. This can be done by using a progressive react application.

For a new project, get started with the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app tkey-mpc-demo --template cra-template-pwa-typescript
cd tkey-mpc-demo
```

For an existing project, add a service worker.

### Setting up the service worker

Further, we need to setup the service worker according to our needs of the project, i.e handling the
redirect login flow. Service worker basically sits between the frontend application, browser and the
network. For the simplicity of this guide, we have added a boilerplate code. The easiest way to do
that is as follows

```bash
mkdir public/serviceworker
wget https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-core-kit-examples/blob/main/tkey/tkey-react-popup-example/public/serviceworker/sw.js -O public/serviceworker/sw.js
```

> For polyfill issues and BigInt issue, please checkout the
> [troubleshooting page](/troubleshooting/webpack-issues).

For this guide, we'll be using a React application to demonstrate how the Web3Auth MPC SDK works.
You can use any other framework of your choice using any other Web3Auth [Guides](/guides) /
[Examples](/examples). Just modify the functions to make it work.

## Installation

We will be starting with a 2/2 flow, i.e `Factor1: Social Factor` and `Factor2: Device Factor`.
Please note that this terminology is different from our conventional terminology of Shares A and B
since we will not be constructing the private key in the frontend. Instead, we will be using the
these **Factors** stored in the different locations to make a final signature.

For this project, we will be using the `@tkey-mpc/default` package alongside multiple helper
packages, that contain all the needed functionalities of the tKey MPC SDK. We will be using the
following packages highlighted in the package.json file:

```json title="package.json"

```

These packages are quite similar to our current tKey JS SDK, however contain some additional
parameters and functions needed for MPC. You can also refer to our
[tKey JS SDK Reference](/sdk/infra/tkey) for more details on the conventional functions involved.

### Understanding the Dependencies

###### `@tkey-mpc/*`

Contains all the functionalities of tKey needed for using MPC. These packages help us create the
device factor and login to the Web3Auth.

###### `@toruslabs/*`

Contains all the helper packages developed by Web3Auth/ Torus Labs for MPC implmentation.

###### `bn.js`, `eccrypto`, `jsrsasign`, `keccak256`

These packages help in key generation and signatures.

###### `@web3auth-mpc/ethereum-provider`, `web3`, `@ethereumjs/*`

These packages help in connecting to the Ethereum network and creating transactions.

## Initialization

After Installation, the next step to use Web3Auth Core Kit tKey SDK is to Initialize the SDK.

```ts title="src/tkey.ts"
import ThresholdKey from "@tkey-mpc/core";
import { TorusServiceProvider } from "@tkey-mpc/service-provider-torus";
import { TorusStorageLayer } from "@tkey-mpc/storage-layer-torus";
import { ShareSerializationModule } from "@tkey-mpc/share-serialization";

// Configuration of Service Provider
const torusSp = new TorusServiceProvider({
  useTSS: true,
  customAuthArgs: {
    network: "sapphire_devnet",
    web3AuthClientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", // anything will work on localhost, but get one valid clientID before hosting, from https://dashboard.web3auth.io
    baseUrl: `${window.location.origin}/serviceworker`,
    enableLogging: true,
  },
});

// Configuration of Metadata Storage Layer
const storageLayer = new TorusStorageLayer({
  hostUrl: "https://sapphire-dev-2-1.authnetwork.dev/metadata",
  enableLogging: true,
});

// Configuration of Share Serialization Module
const shareSerializationModule = new ShareSerializationModule();

// Instantiation of tKey
export const tKey = new ThresholdKey({
  enableLogging: true,
  serviceProvider: torusSp as any,
  storageLayer: storageLayer as any,
  manualSync: true,
  modules: {
    shareSerialization: shareSerializationModule,
  },
});
```

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
useEffect(() => {
  const init = async () => {
    // Initialization of Service Provider
    try {
      await (tKey.serviceProvider as any).init();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };
  init();
}, []);
```

### Adding the MPC utils file

We have created an `utils.ts` file to help us with the MPC functionalities. You can directly copy
this file from our
[GitHub Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkey/tkey-mpc-examples/main/tkey-mpc-web/tkey-mpc-react-popup-example/src/utils.ts)
or the code below.

<TkeyMPCUtils />

## Triggering Login using Service Provider

Once you have initialized the Web3Auth Service Provider, you're ready to trigger the login process.
This is a needed step since this will generate a private key which will be needed by the tKey to
generate it's share. This is done by calling the `triggerLogin()` function within the `tKey`
instance's of `serviceProvider` property.

```tsx
const triggerLogin = async () => {
  if (!tKey) {
    uiConsole("tKey not initialized yet");
    return;
  }
  try {
    // Triggering Login using Service Provider ==> opens the popup
    const loginResponse = await (tKey.serviceProvider as any).triggerLogin({
      typeOfLogin: "google",
      verifier: "google-tkey-w3a",
      clientId: "774338308167-q463s7kpvja16l4l0kko3nb925ikds2p.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    });
    console.log("loginResponse", loginResponse);

    setLoginResponse(loginResponse);
    setUser(loginResponse.userInfo);
    return loginResponse;
  } catch (error) {
    uiConsole(error);
  }
};
```

## Initialize tKey

Once you have triggered the login process, you're ready to initialize the tKey. This will generate
you a Metadata Key corresponding to your login provider, which helps the SDK detect the login of the
user. Additionally. we'll generate the device (factor2) factor and store/retrieve it from the local
storage helping us to setup the 2/2 basic flow to make transactions.

### Check if user is new or existing

The Web3Auth Metadata stores the information about the user's key locations, like how many keys are
generated, which factorPub represents which key according to the set description etc. You can
customise what information you want to store in the metadata. The utils file we created earlier has
a function called `addFactorKeyMetadata` which is used to add data in the metadata, you can
customise that according to your needs.

By default, if the key is not present, the metadata returns a `KEY_NOT_FOUND` message. We can use
this to check if the user is new or existing.

```tsx
const isMetadataPresent = async (privateKeyBN: BN) => {
  const metadata = await tKey.storageLayer.getMetadata({ privKey: privateKeyBN });
  if (
    metadata &&
    Object.keys(metadata).length > 0 &&
    (metadata as any).message !== "KEY_NOT_FOUND"
  ) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};
```

### Store tKey device factor in local storage

Since we are use the tKey Core MPC SDK, we need to implement the device storage functions ourselves.
We'll be using the local storage to store the device share for this example.

```tsx
import BN from "bn.js";

const [localFactorKey, setLocalFactorKey] = useState<BN | null>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (!localFactorKey) return;
  localStorage.setItem(
    `tKeyLocalStore\u001c${loginResponse.userInfo.verifier}\u001c${loginResponse.userInfo.verifierId}`,
    JSON.stringify({
      factorKey: localFactorKey.toString("hex"),
      verifier: loginResponse.userInfo.verifier,
      verifierId: loginResponse.userInfo.verifierId,
    }),
  );
}, [localFactorKey]);
```

### Implementing the main `initializeNewKey` function

```tsx
import { addFactorKeyMetadata, getTSSPubKey } from "./utils";
import BN from "bn.js";
import { generatePrivate } from "eccrypto";

const [metadataKey, setMetadataKey] = useState<any>();
const [localFactorKey, setLocalFactorKey] = useState<BN | null>(null);
const [oAuthShare, setOAuthShare] = useState<any>(null);
const [signingParams, setSigningParams] = useState<any>(null);

const initializeNewKey = async () => {
  if (!tKey) {
    uiConsole("tKey not initialized yet");
    return;
  }
  try {
    // Trigger Login using Service Provider
    const loginResponse = await triggerLogin();

    const OAuthShare = new BN(TorusUtils.getPostboxKey(loginResponse), "hex");
    setOAuthShare(OAuthShare); // This private key is the OAuth Metadata Share

    // Filter out the null values from the signatures
    const signatures = loginResponse.sessionData.sessionTokenData
      .filter((i) => Boolean(i))
      .map((session) => JSON.stringify({ data: session.token, sig: session.signature }));

    // Get the Device Share
    const tKeyLocalStoreString = localStorage.getItem(
      `tKeyLocalStore\u001c${loginResponse.userInfo.verifier}\u001c${loginResponse.userInfo.verifierId}`,
    );
    const tKeyLocalStore = JSON.parse(tKeyLocalStoreString || "{}");

    // Define the factorKey variable for later usage. Please note that this factorKey represents the factorKey 2, ie. device share or recovery share in the 2/2 flow
    let factorKey: BN | null = null;

    // Check if the user is new or existing
    const existingUser = await isMetadataPresent(OAuthShare);

    if (!existingUser) {
      // If the user is new, we'll generate a new factorKey & deviceShare and store it in the local storage. The factorKey can be used to get the deviceShare from metadata. Device Share is stored on the metadata encrypted by the factorKey.
      factorKey = new BN(generatePrivate());
      const deviceTSSShare = new BN(generatePrivate());
      const deviceTSSIndex = 2;
      const factorPub = getPubKeyPoint(factorKey);
      await tKey.initialize({ useTSS: true, factorPub, deviceTSSShare, deviceTSSIndex });
    } else {
      if (
        tKeyLocalStore.verifier === loginResponse.userInfo.verifier &&
        tKeyLocalStore.verifierId === loginResponse.userInfo.verifierId
      ) {
        // If the user is existing and the local storage has the factorKey corresponding the logged in user, we'll use that factorKey to get the deviceShare from metadata. Device Share is stored on the metadata encrypted by the factorKey.
        factorKey = new BN(tKeyLocalStore.factorKey, "hex");
      } else {
        // If the user is existing but the local storage doesn't have the factorKey corresponding the logged in user, we'll ask the user to enter the backup factor key to get the deviceShare from metadata.
        try {
          factorKey = await swal("Enter your backup share", {
            content: "input" as any,
          }).then(async (value) => {
            uiConsole(value);
            return await (tKey.modules.shareSerialization as any).deserialize(value, "mnemonic");
          });
        } catch (error) {
          uiConsole(error);
          throw new Error("Invalid backup share");
        }
      }
      // if the factorKey is null, it means the user entered an invalid backup share
      if (factorKey === null) throw new Error("Backup share not found");

      // Get the corresponding TSS share from metadata using the factorKey
      const factorKeyMetadata = await tKey.storageLayer.getMetadata<{
        message: string;
      }>({
        privKey: factorKey,
      });

      // If the metadata doesn't have the TSS Share, it means the user has entered an invalid backup share
      if (factorKeyMetadata.message === "KEY_NOT_FOUND") {
        throw new Error("no metadata for your factor key, reset your account");
      }
      const metadataShare = JSON.parse(factorKeyMetadata.message);
      if (!metadataShare.deviceShare || !metadataShare.tssShare)
        throw new Error("Invalid data from metadata");

      const metadataDeviceShare = metadataShare.deviceShare;

      // Initialize the tKey with the TSS Share from metadata
      await tKey.initialize({ neverInitializeNewKey: true });
      await tKey.inputShareStoreSafe(metadataDeviceShare, true);
    }

    // Checks the requiredShares to reconstruct the tKey, starts from 2 by default and each of the above share reduce it by one.
    const { requiredShares } = tKey.getKeyDetails();
    if (requiredShares > 0) {
      throw `Threshold not met. Required Share: ${requiredShares}. You should reset your account.`;
    }
    // Reconstruct the Metadata Key
    const metadataKey = await tKey.reconstructKey();
    setMetadataKey(metadataKey?.privKey.toString("hex"));

    const tssNonce: number = tKey.metadata.tssNonces![tKey.tssTag];
    // tssShare1 = TSS Share from the social login/ service provider
    const tssShare1PubKeyDetails = await tKey.serviceProvider.getTSSPubKey(tKey.tssTag, tssNonce);
    const tssShare1PubKey = {
      x: tssShare1PubKeyDetails.x.toString("hex"),
      y: tssShare1PubKeyDetails.y.toString("hex"),
    };

    // tssShare2 = TSS Share from the local storage of the device
    const { tssShare: tssShare2, tssIndex: tssShare2Index } = await tKey.getTSSShare(factorKey);

    // derive tss pub key, tss pubkey is implicitly formed using the dkgPubKey and the userShare (as well as userTSSIndex)
    const tssPubKey = getTSSPubKey(tssShare1PubKey, tssShare2, tssShare2Index);
    const compressedTSSPubKey = Buffer.from(
      `${tssPubKey.getX().toString(16, 64)}${tssPubKey.getY().toString(16, 64)}`,
      "hex",
    );

    // save factor key and other metadata on local storage
    if (
      !existingUser ||
      !(
        tKeyLocalStore.verifier === loginResponse.userInfo.verifier &&
        tKeyLocalStore.verifierId === loginResponse.userInfo.verifierId
      )
    ) {
      await addFactorKeyMetadata(tKey, factorKey, tssShare2, tssShare2Index, "local storage share");
    }
    await tKey.syncLocalMetadataTransitions();

    setLocalFactorKey(factorKey);

    const nodeDetails = await tKey.serviceProvider.getTSSNodeDetails();

    // Set Signing Params for the Web3 Provider
    setSigningParams({
      tssNonce,
      tssShare2,
      tssShare2Index,
      compressedTSSPubKey,
      signatures,
      nodeDetails,
    });

    // All done!
    uiConsole(
      "Successfully logged in & initialized MPC TKey SDK",
      "TSS Public Key: ",
      tKey.getTSSPub(),
      "Metadata Key",
      metadataKey.privKey.toString("hex"),
      "With Factors/Shares:",
      tKey.getMetadata().getShareDescription(),
    );
  } catch (error) {
    uiConsole(error, "caught");
  }
};
```

#### Setup Web3 Provider

Once you have set up your tKey instance, you're ready to set up the Web3 Provider. This is the
provider that will be used by the Web3 SDK to sign the transactions.

```tsx
import { setupWeb3 } from "./utils";

const [web3, setWeb3] = useState<any>(null);

## Copy the Local TSS Share into a Manual Backup Factor Key

The following code snippet shows how to copy the local TSS share into a manual backup factor key.
This is useful if you want to create a backup of your device share, without generating new TSS
Shares. Generation of new TSS shares by default has been limited to 3 at the moment. This is to help
save processing time and enhance the user experience.

```tsx
import { copyExistingTSSShareForNewFactor, addFactorKeyMetadata } from "./utils";

const copyTSSShareIntoManualBackupFactorkey = async () => {
  try {
    if (!tKey) {
      throw new Error("tkey does not exist, cannot add factor pub");
    }
    if (!localFactorKey) {
      throw new Error("localFactorKey does not exist, cannot add factor pub");
    }

    const backupFactorKey = new BN(generatePrivate());
    const backupFactorPub = getPubKeyPoint(backupFactorKey);

    await copyExistingTSSShareForNewFactor(tKey, backupFactorPub, localFactorKey);

    const { tssShare: tssShare2, tssIndex: tssIndex2 } = await tKey.getTSSShare(localFactorKey);
    await addFactorKeyMetadata(tKey, backupFactorKey, tssShare2, tssIndex2, "manual share");
    const serializedShare = await (tKey.modules.shareSerialization as any).serialize(
      backupFactorKey,
      "mnemonic",
    );
    await tKey.syncLocalMetadataTransitions();
    uiConsole("Successfully created manual backup. Manual Backup Factor: ", serializedShare);
  } catch (err) {
    uiConsole(`Failed to copy share to new manual factor: ${err}`);
  }
};
```

## Create new TSS Share into a Manual Backup Factor Key

The following code snippet shows how to create a new TSS share into a manual backup factor key.

```tsx
import { addNewTSSShareAndFactor, addFactorKeyMetadata } from "./utils";

const createNewTSSShareIntoManualBackupFactorkey = async () => {
  try {
    if (!tKey) {
      throw new Error("tkey does not exist, cannot add factor pub");
    }
    if (!localFactorKey) {
      throw new Error("localFactorKey does not exist, cannot add factor pub");
    }

    const backupFactorKey = new BN(generatePrivate());
    const backupFactorPub = getPubKeyPoint(backupFactorKey);
    const tKeyShareDescriptions = await tKey.getMetadata().getShareDescription();
    let backupFactorIndex = 2;
    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(tKeyShareDescriptions)) {
      console.log(`value of share ${key}`, value);
      // eslint-disable-next-line no-loop-func, array-callback-return
      value.map((factor: any) => {
        factor = JSON.parse(factor);
        if (factor.tssShareIndex > backupFactorIndex) {
          backupFactorIndex = factor.tssShareIndex;
          console.log(`backupFactorIndex of share ${key}`, backupFactorIndex);
        }
      });
    }
    uiConsole("backupFactorIndex:", backupFactorIndex + 1);
    await addNewTSSShareAndFactor(
      tKey,
      backupFactorPub,
      backupFactorIndex + 1,
      localFactorKey,
      signingParams.signatures,
    );

    const { tssShare: tssShare2, tssIndex: tssIndex2 } = await tKey.getTSSShare(backupFactorKey);
    await addFactorKeyMetadata(tKey, backupFactorKey, tssShare2, tssIndex2, "manual share");
    const serializedShare = await (tKey.modules.shareSerialization as any).serialize(
      backupFactorKey,
      "mnemonic",
    );

    await tKey.syncLocalMetadataTransitions();
    uiConsole(" Successfully created manual backup.Manual Backup Factor: ", serializedShare);
  } catch (err) {
    uiConsole(`Failed to create new manual factor ${err}`);
  }
};
```

## Get Key Details

The following code snippet will help you get the details of the key stored on the metadata server.
Please note these details can be customised and stored according to your needs.

```tsx
const keyDetails = async () => {
  if (!tKey) {
    uiConsole("tKey not initialized yet");
    return;
  }
  // const keyDetails = await tKey.getKeyDetails();

  uiConsole(
    "TSS Public Key: ",
    tKey.getTSSPub(),
    "With Factors/Shares:",
    tKey.getMetadata().getShareDescription(),
  );
  // return keyDetails;
};
```

## Interacting with Blockchain

Once you are done with the setting of the web3 provider, you can use it to make blockchain calls.
This can be used with any EVM compatible chain
