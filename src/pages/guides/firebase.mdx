This guide will cover the basics of how to set up your Web3Auth SDK and Firebase for the integration and provide you with the links on how to develop
a basic web application on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Live Demo:** https://web3auth-core-firebase-demo.vercel.app

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Web3Auth/examples.git
cd web-core-sdk/custom-authentication/firebase-react-core-example
npm install
npm run start
```

## How it works?

---

When integrating Web3Auth with Firebase, the login flow looks something like this:

![Web3Auth Core - Firebase Login Flow](/images/firebase-flow.svg)

- When a user logs in with `Firebase`, Firebase sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for the user, in a self custodial way, resulting in
  easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Prerequisites

---

<Web3AuthPrerequisites />

- A [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com) account to be used as Federated Identity Provider.

- A [Google Developer](https://console.developers.google.com) account to be used as Identity provider for Firebase.

## Setup

---

### Setup your Firebase Project

- Go to your [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and create a Web App. Follow
  [this guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) on how to setup your Firebase Web App project.

###### Create a Firebase Project

- Create a new project by clicking on **Add project** or use your existing project from [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).

  ![Firebase Project - Set up 1](/contents/guides/firebase/firebase-setup-project-1.svg)

- Give your project a name and click on **Continue**

  ![Firebase Project - Set up 2](/contents/guides/firebase/firebase-setup-project-2.svg)

- Finally, click on **Create Project**

  ![Firebase Project - Set up 3](/contents/guides/firebase/firebase-setup-project-3.svg)

###### Select Authentication Provider

- Once the project is created. Set up _authentication_ by clicking on the **Authentication** card from the home screen of your project or choose
  _Authentication_ under **Build** from the left sidebar.

  ![Firebase Project - Set up auth 1](/contents/guides/firebase/firebase-setup-auth-1.svg)

- From **Sign-in method** tab, select any provider you wish to enanle. For the purpose of this guide, we'll be enabling **Google**.

  ![Firebase Project - Set up auth 2](/contents/guides/firebase/firebase-setup-auth-2.svg)

- Finally, toggle the **enable** button and click on **Save**

  ![Firebase Project - Set up auth 3](/contents/guides/firebase/firebase-setup-auth-3.svg)

###### Configure Firebase for Web

- Once the project is created and authentication is configured. Let's use Firebase for Web by clicking on the `</>` button on the home screen of your
  project.

  ![Firebase Project - Set up web 1](/contents/guides/firebase/firebase-setup-web-1.svg)

- In the next screen, enter the **App nickname** and click on **Register** button to register the app for Web.

  ![Firebase Project - Set up web 2](/contents/guides/firebase/firebase-setup-web-2.svg)

- Next screen shows ways to add **Firebase** to your application. We will be using the config from here later in the guide. Please keep a note of the
  `firebaseConfig` object.

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

- Create a **Verifier** from the **Custom Auth** Section of the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) with following
  configuration:

  - Choose a name of your choice for the verifier identifier. `eg. w3a-firebase-verifier`
  - Select environment: `testnet`, `mainnet` or `cyan` as per your requirement.
  - Select `Custom` from the **Login Provider**.
  - Select `Sub` for the **JWT Verifier ID**.
  - Enter `https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com` as the JWK endpoint for Firebase's idToken.
  - JWT validation fields:
    - iss: `https://securetoken.google.com/<firebase-project-id>`.
    - aud: `<firebase-project-id>`
  - Click on `Create` button to create your verifier. It may take up to 10 minutes to deploy verifier on _testnet_. You'll receive an email once it's
    complete.

  ![Custom Authentication - Create Firebase Verifier](/contents/guides/firebase/firebase-custom-verifier.png)

- You will require the `verifierName` of the newly created verifier and `clientId` of the Plug and Play Project.

## Using the Web3Auth SDK with Firebase

---

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth to your project. To know more about the available
SDKs, please have a look at this [documentation page](/sdk).

For this guide here, we will be talking through the [Web3Auth Plug and Play Core SDK](/sdk/web/core) and using the
[OpenLogin Provider](/sdk/web/openlogin) alongside it to enable Custom Authentication through Firebase.

<SetupBaseProject />

### Installation

<InstallationWithFirebase />

### Initialization

<InitializationIntro />

For this guide, we're only focusing on the Instantiation, Configuration for the Openlogin Adapter (the default adapter that enables social logins) and
Initialization of the Web3Auth SDK. To know more about the other things you can do with Web3Auth, checkout our [SDK Reference](/sdk/web/core).

#### Instantiating Web3Auth

<InstantiationWeb3Auth />

##### Initialize Firebase with Firebase configuration

```js
// Import the functions you need from the SDK
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyDEfyUmXDhgGWibRUro2EBoX8-TtBKMYyA",
  authDomain: "web3auth-x-firebase-demo-e3332.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "web3auth-x-firebase-demo-e3332",
  storageBucket: "web3auth-x-firebase-demo-e3332.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "108145034076",
  appId: "1:108145034076:web:3ff4c0088ec4c311b17799",
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

Import `initializeApp` from the Firebase SDK and use the firebaseConfig obtained above to initialize the Firebase web app.

#### Initialising the Openlogin Adapter

<OpenloginConfigCodeFirebase />

Here, you need to pass over your Web3Auth `clientId` in the adapterSettings object and your Custom Auth `verifierName` in the loginConfig object. This
makes sure that the Openlogin Adapter can connect to the correct verifier and Firebase server.

<InitializationWeb3Auth />

### Authentication

Login is a two step process:

1. Firstly, we will login with **Firebase(Google)** to get the `idToken`.
2. Next, we will pass the received `idToken` to **web3auth** to login via Web3Auth SDK to generate the public-private key pair for easier onboarding
   to Web3.

##### Login with Firebase

```js
import { GoogleAuthProvider, getAuth, signInWithPopup, UserCredential } from "firebase/auth";

const signInWithGoogle = async (): Promise<UserCredential> => {
  try {
    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    const auth = getAuth(app);
    const googleProvider = new GoogleAuthProvider();
    const res = await signInWithPopup(auth, googleProvider);
    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    throw err;
  }
};

const loginRes = await signInWithGoogle();
const idToken = await loginRes.user.getIdToken(true); // this idToken will be passed to web3auth
```

##### Login with Web3Auth

Once initialized, and `idToken` is obtained from **Firebase**, you can use the `connectTo()` function to authenticate the user with Web3Auth.

```js
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    id_token: idToken,
    verifierIdField: "sub", // same as your JWT Verifier ID
    domain: "https://YOUR-APPLICATION-DOMAIN" || "http://localhost:3000",
  },
});
```

When connecting, your `connectTo` function takes the arguments for the adapter you want to connect to and the options for the login. Few major things
to note here is the `idToken` and `domain` option in the `extraLoginOptions` object. This is the idToken received from Firebase SDK and domain is your
application domain so that you can be redirected after login from the Web3Auth Plug and Play Core SDK.

### Get the User Profile

```js
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

Using the `getUserInfo` function, you can get the details of the logged in user. Please note that these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth
network, but are fetched from the id_token you received from Firebase and lives in the frontend context.

### Logout

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.

```js
await web3auth.logout();
```
