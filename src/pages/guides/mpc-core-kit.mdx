This guide will help you create a React application using Web3Auth's MPC Core Kit SDK, covering the
basic functionalities of how to use it.

**Live Demo:** [https://w3a.link/mpc-example](https://w3a.link/mpc-example)

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit Web3Auth/web3auth-core-kit-examples/mpc-core-kit-web/implicit-flow-examples/mpc-core-kit-popup-flow-example w3a-mpc-core-kit-popup-flow-example && npm install && npm start
```

## Prerequisites

- A basic knowledge of JavaScript and React.
- A Web3Auth account on the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) and a verifier.

## Understanding the Web3Auth MPC Core Kit SDK

With Web3Auth infrastructure, your key is divided into multiple parts and stored across your devices
and our Auth Network. This ensures that your key is always available and never stored in a single
place. While in the traditional Web3Auth SDK, your key was dynamically reconstructed in the frontend
using shamir secret sharing. With the new Web3Auth MPC (Multi-Party Computation) architecture, it is
**never reconstructed**. Instead, these partial keys are stored across different locations, and your
device is used to make partial signatures for your message/transaction. These are finally returned
to the frontend where using TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme), these signatures are combined to make
a final signature. You can use this finally signed message/transaction to make a transaction on the
blockchain.

[**MPC Core Kit SDK Reference**](/sdk/mpc-core-kit/mpc-core-kit-js).

## Installation

Let's start by adding the
[`@web3auth/mpc-core-kit`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/mpc-core-kit) package.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/mpc-core-kit
```

#### Web3 Libraries

Depending on your preference, you can choose to install the `web3`, `ethers`, or `viem` libraries to
interact with the EVM-compatible blockchains under the hood.

We'll be using `web3` for this guide.

```shell
npm install --save web3
```

## Initialization

Once installed, your Web3Auth application needs to be initialized. Initialization is a two-step
process where we add all the config details for Web3Auth:

1. Instantiation
2. Initialization

Ensure all of this happens in your application constructor. This ensures that Web3Auth is
initialized when your application starts up.

### Importing the Packages

```tsx
import { Web3AuthMPCCoreKit, WEB3AUTH_NETWORK } from "@web3auth/mpc-core-kit";
import { CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";
```

### Instantiate the SDK

```tsx
const coreKitInstance = new Web3AuthMPCCoreKit({
  web3AuthClientId:
    "BPi5PB_UiIZ-cPz1GtV5i1I2iOSOHuimiXBI0e-Oe_u6X3oVAbCiAZOTEBtTXw4tsluTITPqA8zMsfxIKMjiqNQ",
  web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.MAINNET,
  setupProviderOnInit: false, // needed to skip the provider setup
  manualSync: true, // This is the recommended approach
});

const chainConfig = {
  chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155,
  chainId: "0x1", // Use 0xaa36a7 for Sepolia Testnet
  rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth",
  displayName: "Ethereum Mainnet",
  blockExplorer: "https://etherscan.io/",
  ticker: "ETH",
  tickerName: "Ethereum",
};

const evmProvider = new EthereumSigningProvider({ config: { chainConfig } });
evmProvider.setupProvider(coreKitInstance);
```

Here, we're instantiating the Web3Auth MPC CoreKit SDK and using the `chainConfig` property to set
the chainId and chainNamespace. The `chainId` and `chainNamespace` are the id and the namespace
respectively of the EVM chain you're connecting to. We've initialized them for the Ethereum Mainnet
chain for this guide.

Sometimes, you might face network congestion. To avoid this, you can use the `rpcTarget` property to
specify the URL of the node you want to connect to.

### Initialize the SDK

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.init();
// This will initialize the SDK

// Check the status of the SDK with
coreKitInstance.status;
```

## Authentication

### Logging In

Once initialized, you can use the `loginWithOauth()` or `loginWithJWT()` function to authenticate
the user when they click the login button. Here, you can use a Single verifier or an Aggregate
verifier to authenticate the user.

<Tabs
defaultValue="single"
values={[
  { label: "Single Verifier", value: "single" },
  { label: "Aggregate Verifier", value: "aggregate" },
]}
>
<TabItem value="single">

```tsx
const web3authProvider = await coreKitInstance.loginWithOauth({
  subVerifierDetails: {
    typeOfLogin: "google",
    verifier: "w3a-google-demo", // your verifier name
    clientId: "519228911939-cri01h55lsjbsia1k7ll6qpalrus75ps.apps.googleusercontent.com", // your client id received from google
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="aggregate">

```tsx
// Google Login
const web3authProvider = await coreKitInstance.loginWithOauth({
  aggregateVerifierIdentifier: "aggregate-sapphire",
  subVerifierDetails: {
    typeOfLogin: "google",
    verifier: "w3a-google", // your verifier name
    clientId: "519228911939-cri01h55lsjbsia1k7ll6qpalrus75ps.apps.googleusercontent.com", // your client id received from google
  },
});
```

```tsx
// Facebook Login
const web3authProvider = await coreKitInstance.loginWithOauth({
  aggregateVerifierIdentifier: "aggregate-sapphire",
  subVerifierDetails: {
    typeOfLogin: "facebook",
    verifier: "w3a-facebook", // your verifier name
    clientId: "1222658941886084", // your client id received from facebook
  },
});
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

When connecting, your `loginWithOauth()` function takes the arguments to connect to the
`loginProvider` for the login.

### Get the User Profile

```tsx
const user = await coreKitInstance.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

Using the `getUserInfo` function, you can get the details of the logged-in user. Please note that
these details are not stored anywhere in the Web3Auth network but are fetched from the ID token you
received from AWS Cognito and live in the frontend context.

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.

### Get Key Details

Returns the details of how the user's key is managed by the MPC Core Kit.

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.getKeyDetails();
```

**For more usage, please check the
[MPC Core Kit SDK Usage](/sdk/mpc-core-kit/mpc-core-kit-js/usage).**

### Logout

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.logout();
```

## Interacting with Blockchain

Once you have set up the web3 provider, you can use it to make blockchain calls. This can be used
with any EVM-compatible chain.

:::tip

You can check our [Connect Blockchain](/connect-blockchain) documentation, which has a detailed
guide on how to connect to major blockchains.
