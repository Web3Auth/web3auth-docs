This guide will cover the basics of how to integrate Web3Auth with OAuth 2.0, using Microsoft Github
authentication. Trying to explain all the flow and covering all the problems that can happen during
the integration. Web3Auth is employed to provide Ethereum private key access and public address.

Full example:
https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-core-kit-examples/tree/main/single-factor-auth-node/microsoft-oauth-connection

We use two web3auth libraries in this project: `@web3auth/ethereum-provider` and
`@web3auth/node-sdk`.

To install them, run: `npm install @web3auth/ethereum-provider @web3auth/node-sdk`

## How it works?

When integrating Web3Auth with Microsoft Login the flow looks something like this:

![Microsoft flow](/images/oauth/microsoft-oauth-flow.jpg)

- When a user logs in with `Microsoft`, Microsoft sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token
  is sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for
  the user, in a self custodial way, resulting in easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Create a JWKS file

A JWKS stands for JSON Web Key Set. It is a set of keys containing the public keys that should be
used to verify any JSON Web Token (JWT) issued by the authorization server and signed using the
RS256 signing algorithm.

If you don't know how to create a JWKS, you can follow this
[web3auth tutorial](/docs/auth-provider-setup/byo-jwt-provider/#how-to-create-jwks). This file must
be located on a public endpoint. To test the example, you will need to modify the file located in
the root directory of the project.

Both the private and the public keys, that you used to create the JWKS, must be in the server
directory. In our project, they are called `private.pem` and `public.pem`.

## Set up Custom JWT Verifier

![Custom JWT Provider on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/dashboard/create-verifier-custom-jwt.png)

To create a custom verifier for your JWT Provider, you'll need the follow this steps:

1. The verifier Identifier, which would be the name. This name should be used in your .ENV file as
   `WEB3AUTH_VERIFIER`.

2. **JWT Verifier ID**: JWT Verifier ID is the unique identifier to publicly represent a user on a
   verifier. e.g: `sub`, `email`, or even a custom field of your JWT payload that is unique in your
   system for each user. In this case, we are using the `sub` field.

3. **JWK Endpoint**: An endpoint containing the JWKS used to sign the JWT. In my example I'm using a
   static github url file.

4. In the Select JWT Validation. You will add `iss` and `aud` fields.
   - The `iss` field is the issuer of the JWT. In this case "https://login.microsoftonline.com/"
   - The `aud` field is the audience of the JWT. In this case
     "http://login.microsoftonline.com/{AZURE_TENANT_ID}/v2.0/token"

## Configure a new Application in Microsoft Entra.

After creating the app, you'll need the Application (client) ID and the Directory (tenant) ID into
the .ENV file. Then you can add a redirect URI (in our example is http://localhost:5005/ms/callback)

Finally in "Certificates & secrets" -> Client Secret -> New client secret and copy the value to the
.ENV file as `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

## Create a Proof Key of Code Exchange (PKCE)

The Proof Key of Code Exchange (PKCE) is an extension of the standard authorization code grant OAuth
flow. It is designed to be a secure substitute for the implicit flow for single-page applications
(SPA) or native applications. SPAs and native applications are vulnerable to reverse engineering
practices. To create one you can go to this
[PKCE generator](https://tonyxu-io.github.io/pkce-generator/). First click on "generate code
Verfier" and then into "Generate Code Challenge". Both values will be used in the .ENV file as
`AZURE_CODE_VERIFIER` and `AZURE_CODE_CHALLENGE`.

## Running the example

Execute `npm run dev`. To initiate the Microsoft OAuth flow, Open your browser to
`http://localhost:5005/ms/login`

Finally, after loginning in as a result, you will receive in the callback url a JSON with the user
data, the JWT token, the Ethereum address and private key.

```json
{
  "userData": {
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users/$entity",
    "businessPhones": [],
    "displayName": "Display ... Name",
    "givenName": "Name",
    "jobTitle": null,
    "mail": null,
    "mobilePhone": null,
    "officeLocation": null,
    "preferredLanguage": "en",
    "surname": "Raw",
    "userPrincipalName": "data_gmail.com#EXT#@datagmail.onmicrosoft.com",
    "id": "63af4d94-1ea4-4b0b-aaa9-0da5d044xxxx"
  },
  "jwtToken": "eyJhbGci ... z9HgEQOcYTg",
  "ethData": {
    "ethPrivateKey": "b070a6 ... 3536",
    "ethPublicAddress": ["0xb31181bd22b57f994d ... d2ff72ad0631251fd"]
  }
}
```

## Code guide

In the example, we are using express for the server. This are the Endpoint that we are using:

- The initial endpoint to start the Microsoft OAuth flow.

```javascript
app.get("/ms/login", async (req: any, res: any) => {
    const oauthUrl = `${MICROSOFT_URL}/${azureTenantId}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
        client_id=${azureClientId}
        &response_type=code
        &redirect_uri=${encodeURIComponent(azureRedirectUri)}
        &response_mode=query
        &scope=User.ReadBasic.All
        &state=w3a_microsoft
        &prompt=login
        &code_challenge=${azurCodeChallenge}
        &code_challenge_method=S256`;
    res.redirect(oauthUrl);
});
```

- The Callback endpoint to receive the JWT token and exchange it for an access token.

```javascript
app.get("/ms/callback", async (req: any, res: any) => {
    const code = req.query.code;
    try {
        const accessToken = await exchangeCodeForAccessToken(code);
        const userData = await fetchMicrosoftUserDetails(accessToken);
        const jwtToken = generateJwtToken(userData);
        const ethData = await getPrivateKey(jwtToken, userData.id.toString());
        res.json({ userData, jwtToken, ethData });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send("Error during Microsoft authentication callback");
    }
});
```

In the `getPrivateKey` function, we use Web3auth to establish a connection with the provider and get
both the address and the private key.

```javascript
const getPrivateKey = async (idToken: string, verifierId: string) => {
    const web3authNodeprovider = await web3auth.connect({
        verifier: process.env.WEB3AUTH_VERIFIER,
        verifierId,
        idToken,
    });
    // The private key returned here is the CoreKit Key
    const ethPrivateKey = await web3authNodeprovider.request({ method: "eth_private_key" });
    const ethPublicAddress = await web3authNodeprovider.request({ method: "eth_accounts" });
    const ethData = {
        ethPrivateKey,
        ethPublicAddress,
    };
    return ethData;
};
```

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined here, developers can seamlessly incorporate Web3Auth into their
applications. This guide serves as a comprehensive resource for developers seeking to integrate
Web3Auth and Microsoft Github users authenticate with OAuth 2.0 Flow. Also can be a starting point
for developers who want to integrate Web3Auth with other OAuth providers.
