In this guide, we'll talk about how we can use Web3Auth Single Factor Auth with Firebase in your
Flutter application.

As an overview, the guide is quite simple, with functionality to log in, display user details, and
perform blockchain interactions. The signing of the blockchain transactions is done through the
Web3Auth embedded wallet. You can check out the infrastructure docs,
["Web3Auth Wallet Management Infrastructure"](/docs/infrastructure) for a high-level overview of the
Web3Auth architecture and implementation. For those who want to skip straight to the code, you can
find it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-core-kit-examples/tree/main/single-factor-auth-flutter/sfa-flutter-quick-start).

## How to set up Web3Auth Dashboard

If you haven't already, sign up on the Web3Auth platform. It is free and gives you access to the
Web3Auth's base plan. After the basic setup, explore other features and functionalities offered by
the Web3Auth Dashboard. It includes custom verifiers, whitelabeling, analytics, and more. Head to
[Web3Auth's documentation](/docs/dashboard-setup) page for detailed instructions on setting up the
Web3Auth Dashboard.

## How to set up Firebase for Flutter

If you haven't already setup the Firebase for your Flutter app, please setup the Firebase, as it's
the prerequisites for the guide. Head to the
[Firebase's documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) for the details
instructions.

## How to set up Custom verifier

Once, you have set up the Web3Auth Dashboard, created a new project, and set up Firebase, it's time
to create a Custom Verifier for your Firebase application. We already have detail instructions on
how to create a Custom Verifier for Firebase, please head to our
[documentation](https://web3auth.io/docs/auth-provider-setup/authentication-service-providers/firebase-service-provider).

## Integrating Web3Auth SFA in Flutter

Once, you have set up the Custom Verifier, it's time to integrate Web3Auth in your Flutter
application. For the implementation, we'll use the "single_factor_auth_flutter. This SDK facilitates
integration with Web3Auth. This way you can easily manage embedded wallet in your Flutter
application.

### Installation

To install the single_factor_auth_flutter package, you have two options. You can either manually add
the package in the `pubspec.yaml` file, or you can use the `flutter pub add` command.

<Tabs defaultValue = "console"
  values={[
    { label: "Console", value: "console", },
    { label: "Pubspec", value: "pubspec", },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="console">
Add `single_factor_auth_flutter` using `flutter pub add` command.

```sh
flutter pub add single_factor_auth_flutter
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pubspec">
Add `single_factor_auth_flutter` as a dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`.

<Pubspec />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Initialization

After successfully installing the package, the next step is to initialize `SingleFactAuthFlutter` in
your Flutter app. This sets up the necessary configurations using Web3Auth network and prepares the
SDK. [Learn more about SingleFactAuthFlutter Initialization](/docs/sdk/sfa/sfa-flutter/initialize).

<Initialization />

### Session Management

To check whether the user is authenticated, you can use the `initialize` method. For a user already
authenticated, the result would be a non-nullable `SFAKey`. You can navigate to different views
based on the result.

<SessionManagement />

### Authentication

If the user is not authenticated, you should utilize the `connect` method. For the guide, we will
add Email Password login using Firebase. The `connect` method is pretty straightforward in
`SingleFactAuthFlutter` and takes `LoginParams` as input. After successfully logging in, the method
will return the `SFAKey`.

Learn more about [SingleFactAuthFlutter LoginParams](/docs/sdk/sfa/sfa-flutter/usage#parameters).
For interacting with Firebase we'll create a `FirebaseHelper` class.

```dart
import 'dart:developer';

import 'package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class FirebaseHelper {
  final FirebaseAuth _auth;

  FirebaseHelper({required FirebaseAuth auth}) : _auth = auth;

  // Sign in with Email and Password
  Future<UserCredential> signInWithEmailAndPassword(
    String email,
    String password,
  ) async {
    try {
      return await _auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
        email: email,
        password: password,
      );
    } catch (e) {
      log(e.toString());
      rethrow;
    }
  }

  // Sign out
  Future<void> signOut(BuildContext context) async {
    await _auth.signOut();
  }

  // Get the current user
  User? getCurrentUser() {
    return _auth.currentUser;
  }
}
```

Once we hace created the FirebaseHelper class, we can use it login the user, and get the idToken.
Once we have the idToken, we can use it to `connect` method to authenticate user. To more about
Firebase login methods, please
[checkout the Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/flutter/start).

```dart
final firebaseHelper = FirebaseHelper(auth: FirebaseAuth.instance);

final userCredential = await firebaseHelper.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
    'sfa.flutter@w3a.link',
    'Testing@123',
);

final user = userCredential.user;
final token = await user.getIdToken(true);

// focus-start
final loginParams = LoginParams(
  // Replace with your verifier
  verifier: 'web3auth-firebase-examples',
  // Replace with the verifierId value, can be email, sub, or custom
  verifierId: 'sfa.flutter@w3a.link',
  idToken: token!,
)

final sfaKey = await singleFactAuthFlutter.connect(loginParams);
// focus-end

log(sfaKey.privateKey);
log(sfaKey.publicAddress);
```

## Set up Blockchain Providers

Once we have successfully authenticated the user, the next step would be to fetch the user details,
retrieve wallet address and prepare blockchain providers for interactions. For this guide, we are
supporting only Ethereum ecosystem, but the general idea can be used for any blockchain ecosystem.

For interacting with ethereum chains, we'll use the [web3dart](https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart)
SDK. To install the web3dart package, you have two options. You can either manually add the package
in the `pubspec.yaml` file, or you can use the `flutter pub add` command.

<Tabs defaultValue = "console"
  values={[
    { label: "Console", value: "console", },
    { label: "Pubspec", value: "pubspec", },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="console">
Add `web3dart` using `flutter pub add` command.

```sh
flutter pub add web3dart
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pubspec">
Add `web3dart` as a dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`.

```yaml
dependencies:
  web3dart: ^2.7.3
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After successfully installing package, it's time to create `Credentials` instance to retrive user's
EOA address, and sign the transactions. To retrive the user's private key, we'll use the `SFAKey`
instance.

```dart
// focus-next-line
final credentials = EthPrivateKey.fromHex(sfaKey.privateKey);

// User's EOA address
log(credentials.address)
```

To retrive user's balance, and interacting with Blockcahin, you can follow our detailed guide on how
to [interact with EVM chain guides](/docs/connect-blockchain/evm/ethereum/flutter#get-balance).
Since, you already have created `Credentials` instance, and retrived the user's EOA address, you can
skip that part. To interact with Solana blockchain, you can checkout our
[Solana blockchain guide](/docs/connect-blockchain/solana/flutter).
