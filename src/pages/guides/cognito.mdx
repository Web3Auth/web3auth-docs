This guide will cover the basics of how to set up your Web3Auth SDK and AWS Cognito for the integration and provide you with the links on how to
develop a basic web application on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Web3Auth/examples.git
cd cognito-react-example
npm install
npm run start
```

## How it works?

<Tabs
defaultValue="implicit"
values={[
  { label: "Implicit Flow", value: "implicit" },
  { label: "Authorization Code Flow", value: "authcode" },
]}
>
<TabItem value="implicit">

When integrating Web3Auth with AWS Cognito the Implicit flow looks something like this:

![AWS Cognito - Implicit Flow](/contents/guides/cognito/cognito-implicit.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="authcode">

When integrating Web3Auth with AWS Cognito the Authorization code flow looks something like this:

![AWS Cognito - Authorization Code Flow](/contents/guides/cognito/cognito-authcode.png)

For Authorization code flow, you will need an additional backend server to communicate with AWS Cognito to get the `id_token` in exchange of
`authorization_code` received.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

- When a user logs in with AWS Cognito, Cognito sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for the user, in a self custodial way, resulting in
  easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Prerequisites

---

<Web3AuthPrerequisites />

- An [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/console) account to create AWS Cognito User Poll.

- A [Google Developer](https://console.developers.google.com) account to be used as Identity provider for AWS Cognito.

## Setup

---

### Setup your AWS Cognito

- Go to your AWS account and go to [AWS Cognito](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home) console. And Create a new user pool by following
  [this AWS Console guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-console.html).

- Note down the `userPoolId` and `region` after creating the new user pool.

- Add a new app client to the user pool from App clients tab under General settings of your pool settings. Note down the `App client id` for this app
  client, that looks something like `3j2tXXXXkkff5ajpn`. We will use this as the `aud` value for the JWT validation field.

  ![AWS Cognito - Create app client](/contents/guides/cognito/cognito-create-app-client.png)

- Add a domain to your AWS Cognito App from `App integration > Domain name` section.

- We will use Google login as Identity provider in AWS Cognito for this guide.

  - Obtain the OAuth `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from your [Google Developer dashboard](https://console.developers.google.com). Follow Google’s
    instructions to [set up an OAuth 2.0 App](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en).

  - While configuring your Google OAuth 2.0 client for web, make sure to enter
    - `<AWS_COGNITO_DOMAIN>` in the `Authorized Javascript Origins list` and,
    - `<AWS_COGNITO_DOMAIN>/oauth2/idpresponse` in the Authorized redirect URIs list.

- Let's configure Google login in AWS Cognito.

  - Go to identity providers tab under federation tab and select Google.
  - It will require you to enter your Google app's `Client ID` and `Client Secret` which you get in the above steps.
    - Paste `Client ID` in the Google app ID field.
    - Paste `Client Secret` in the App secret field.
    - Type `profile email openid` in the Authorize scope field.
      ![AWS Cognito - Google Login Identity configuration](/contents/guides/cognito/cognito-google-identity.png)
    - Your Google login provider is configured, you can enable it in your App client settings under App Integration settings of your pool settings.
      ![AWS Cognito - Enable Google Identity](/contents/guides/cognito/cognito-enable-google-identity.png)
    - **Map email from Google attribute to user pool attribute**.
      - In the Amazon Cognito console, choose Manage user pools, and then choose your user pool.
      - In the left navigation pane, under Federation, choose `Attribute mapping`.
      - On the attribute mapping page, choose the `Google` tab.
      - Next to the Google attribute named `email`, select the Capture check box.
      - Next to email, for User pool attribute, choose `Email` from the list.
      - Choose Save changes.

- Update App client settings to set the desired OAuth flow and redirect endpoints. For this guide, we will be using the _Implicit OAuth flow_.

  - Click on `App client settings` under **App integration**.
  - Callback URL(s): `http://localhost:3000/callback, https://beta.openlogin.com/auth`
  - Sign out URL(s): `http://localhost:3000`
    - Additional to your own URLs for the application, please add
      - [https://beta.openlogin.com/auth](https://beta.openlogin.com/auth) (for Web3Auth testnet used in demo applications) and
      - [https://app.openlogin.com/auth](https://app.openlogin.com/auth) (for Web3Auth mainnet used in production applications).
  - OAuth2.0
    - Select [x] `Implicit grant` from **Allowed OAuth Flows**
    - Select [x] `email` `openid` `profile` from **Allowed OAuth Scopes**
      ![AWS Cognito - App Client Settings Final](/contents/guides/cognito/cognito-final-app-client-settings.png)
  - **Save Changes** and your Cognito app is configured to use Web3Auth.

- Now lets configure Web3Auth using AWS Cognito app details.

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

- Create a **Verifier** from the **Custom Auth** Section of the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) with following
  configuration:

  - Choose a name of your choice for the verifier identifier. `eg. aws-cognito-verifier`
  - Select environment: `testnet`, `mainnet` or `cyan` as per your requirement.
  - Select `Custom` from the **Login Provider**.
  - Select `Email` for the **JWT Verifier ID**.
  - Your JWK endpoint endpoint for aws cognito will look something like this:
    `https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{userPoolId}/.well-known/jwks.json`. Get the `region` and `userPoolId` value from your AWS Cognito
    console.
  - JWT validation fields:
    - iss: `https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{userPoolId}`.
    - aud: `App client id` the from AWS Cognito console.
  - Click on `Create` button to create your verifier. It may take up to 10 minutes to deploy verifier on _testnet_. You'll receive an email once it's
    complete.

  ![Custom Authentication - Create AWS Cognito Verifier](/contents/guides/cognito/cognito-create-verifier.png)

- You will require the `verifierName` of the newly created verifier and `clientId` of the Plug and Play Project.

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

---

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth to your project. To know more about the available
SDKs, please have a look at this [documentation page](/developing-with-web3auth/understand-sdk).

For this guide here, we will be talking through the [Web3Auth Plug and Play Core SDK](/sdk/web/core) and using the
[OpenLogin Provider](/sdk/web/adapters/openlogin) alongside it to enable Custom Authentication through AWS Cognito.

<SetupBaseProject />

### Installation

<Installation />

### Initialization

<InitializationIntro />

For this guide, we're only focusing on the Instantiation, Configuration for the Openlogin Adapter (the default adapter that enables social logins) and
Initialization of the Web3Auth SDK. To know more about the other things you can do with Web3Auth, checkout our [SDK Reference](/sdk/web/core).

#### Instantiating Web3Auth

<InstantiationWeb3Auth />

#### Initialising the Openlogin Adapter

<OpenloginConfigCode />

Here, you need to pass over your Web3Auth `clientId` in the adapterSettings object and your Custom Auth `verifierName` and AWS Cognito `clientId` in
the loginConfig object. This makes sure that the Openlogin Adapter can connect to the correct verifier and AWS Cognito server.

<InitializationWeb3Auth />

### Authentication

#### Logging in

Once initialized, you can use the `connectTo()` function to authenticate the user when they click the login button.

```js
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    domain: "https://YOUR-AWS-COGNITO-DOMAIN",
    verifierIdField: "email",
    response_type: "token",
    scope: "email profile openid",
  },
});
```

When connecting, your `connectTo` function takes the arguments for the adapter you want to connect to and the options for the login. The major thing
to note here is the `domain` option in the `extraLoginOptions` object. This is the domain of your AWS Cognito pool so that you can be redirected to
login there directly from the Web3Auth Plug and Play Core SDK.

### Get the User Profile

```js
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

Using the `getUserInfo` function, you can get the details of the logged in user. Please note that these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth
network, but are fetched from the id_token you received from AWS Cognito and lives in the frontend context.

### Logout

```js
await web3auth.logout();
```

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.

> Note: Currently, Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs don't log out a user from AWS Cognito, so you can try calling this below endpoint to log out a user.

```js
window.open("
    YOUR-COGNITO-DOMAIN/logout?
    client_id=YOUR-CLIENTID-FROM-AWS-COGNITO-DASHBOARD&
    logout_uri=LOGOUT_URI&
    redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI
");
```

### Difference between Implicit and Authorization code flow

In the **Implicit** flow, the frontend gets the JWT `id_token` from AWS Cognito directly. This flow is leveraged by the Web3Auth SDK, which handles
all the callbacks by itself and the user just needs to setup the `OpenloginAdapter` and connect to the Web3Auth SDK, adding in the AWS Cognito
`client_id` in it. Hence, this is the implicit flow and is the most suitable flow for setting up your authentication via AWS Cognito and Web3Auth.

In the **Authorization code** flow, you have to spin up a server on your own where you'll receive the `authorisation code` from AWS Cognito. For
Web3Auth, still require an `id_token` to be sent to the OpenloginAdapter to log the user in the frontend context. This is where you need to make
another call from the backend server to AWS Cognito to get the `id_token` and pass it over to your frontend where you can send it to the Web3Auth SDK.

### Setting up your application with Authorization code Flow

- In addition to the steps above, select `Authorization code grant` from **Allowed OAuth Flows** on your AWS Cognito Console's App client settings
  page and add callback URLs for both your backend and frontend
- On the frontend, your login button should hit on the following URL

```url
https://{YOUR_DOMAIN}.auth.{region}.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize?
  response_type=code&
  client_id={CLIENT_ID_FROM_AWS}&
  redirect_uri=https://{YOUR_APP}/redirect_uri&
  state=STATE&
  scope=openid+profile+aws.cognito.signin.user.admin
```

- This is where the user is redirected to a login screen by AWS Cognito.
- On successful login, the user will be redirected to your backend server with authorization `code` as a query parameter.
- In the backend server, you can use the `code` to get the `id_token` from AWS Cognito and redirect the user to the frontend with `id_token` as a
  query parameter

```js
app.get('/callback', (req, res) => {
  var options = {
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'https://{YOUR_DOMAIN}.auth.{REGION}.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token',
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
      'Authorization': 'Basic ' + Buffer.from(CLIENT_ID_FROM_AWS + ':' + CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_AWS).toString('base64')
     },
    form:{
      grant_type: 'authorization_code',
      client_id: 'CLIENT_ID_FROM_AWS',
      code: req.query.code, // the authorisation code you got from AWS Cognito
      redirect_uri: 'https://{YOUR_FRONTEND_URL}',
    }
   };

   var id_token = "";

   request(options, function (error, response, data) {
    id_token = JSON.parse(data)["id_token"];
    redirect_url = "http://{YOUR_FRONTEND_URL}?token=%22+id_token;
    // Redirection URL to frontend with `id_token` as a query parameter
    res.redirect(redirect_url);
  });
})
```

- In the frontend, pass on this `id_token` to the Web3Auth SDK to authenticate the user

```js
await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    id_token: "YOUR_ID_TOKEN_FETCHED_FROM_BACKEND_SERVER",
    domain: "https://YOUR-AWS-COGNITO-DOMAIN",
    verifierIdField: "sub",
  },
});
```
