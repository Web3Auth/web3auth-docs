This guide will cover the basics of how to set up your Web3Auth SDK and AWS Cognito for the
integration and provide you with the links on how to develop a basic web application on the Ethereum
blockchain.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/web-no-modal-sdk/custom-authentication/single-verifier-examples/cognito-no-modal-example w3a-cognito-demo && cd w3a-cognito-demo && npm install && npm run start
```

## How it works?

<Tabs
defaultValue="implicit"
values={[
  { label: "Implicit Flow", value: "implicit" },
  { label: "Authorization Code Flow", value: "authcode" },
]}
>
<TabItem value="implicit">

When integrating Web3Auth with AWS Cognito the Implicit flow looks something like this:

![AWS Cognito - Implicit Flow](/guides/cognito/cognito-implicit.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="authcode">

When integrating Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK with AWS Cognito the Authorization code flow
looks something like this:

![AWS Cognito - Authorization Code Flow](/guides/cognito/cognito-authcode.png)

For Authorization code flow, you will need an additional backend server to communicate with AWS
Cognito to get the `id_token` in exchange for `authorization_code` received.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

- When a user logs in with AWS Cognito, Cognito sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is
  sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for
  the user, in a self-custodial way, resulting in easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Prerequisites

<Web3AuthPrerequisites />

- An [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/console) account to create an AWS Cognito User Poll.

- A [Google Developer](https://console.developers.google.com) account to be used as an Identity
  provider for AWS Cognito.

## Setup

### Set up AWS Cognito

<SetupAWSCognito />

### Setup Web3Auth

#### Setup Web3Auth Project

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

#### Setup Firebase Custom Authentication Verifier

<SetupAWSCognitoVerifier />

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth
to your project. To know more about the available SDKs, please have a look at this
[documentation page](/sdk).

For this guide, we will be talking through the
[Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) and using the
[Auth Adapter](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth) alongside it to enable Custom Authentication through AWS
Cognito.

<SetupBaseProject />

### Installation

<Installation />

### Initialization

<InitializationIntro />

For this guide, we're only focusing on the Instantiation, Configuration for the Auth Adapter (the
default adapter that enables social logins) and Initialization of the Web3Auth SDK. To know more
about the other things you can do with Web3Auth, check out our
[SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal).

#### Instantiating Web3Auth

<InstantiationWeb3Auth />

#### Initializing the Auth Adapter

<AuthConfigCode />

Here, you need to pass over your Web3Auth `clientId` in the adapterSettings object and your Custom
Auth `verifierName` and AWS Cognito `clientId` in the loginConfig object. This makes sure that the
Auth Adapter can connect to the correct verifier and AWS Cognito server.

<InitializationWeb3Auth />

### Authentication

#### Logging in

Once initialized, you can use the `connectTo()` function to authenticate the user when they click
the login button.

```tsx
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.AUTH, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    domain: "https://YOUR-AWS-COGNITO-DOMAIN",
    verifierIdField: "email",
    response_type: "token",
    scope: "email profile openid",
  },
});
```

When connecting, your `connectTo` function takes the arguments for the adapter you want to connect
to and the options for the login. The major thing to note here is the `domain` option in the
`extraLoginOptions` object. This is the domain of your AWS Cognito pool so that you can be
redirected to log in there directly from the Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK.

### Get the User Profile

```tsx
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

Using the `getUserInfo` function, you can get the details of the logged-in user. Please note that
these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth network, but are fetched from the id_token you
received from AWS Cognito and live in the frontend context.

### Logout

```tsx
await web3auth.logout();
```

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.

> Note: Currently, Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs don't log out a user from AWS Cognito, so you can try
> calling this below endpoint to log out a user.

```
window.open("
    YOUR-COGNITO-DOMAIN/logout?
    client_id=YOUR-CLIENTID-FROM-AWS-COGNITO-DASHBOARD&
    logout_uri=LOGOUT_URI&
    redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI
");
```

### Difference between Implicit and Authorization code flow

In the **Implicit** flow, the frontend gets the JWT `id_token` from AWS Cognito directly. This flow
is leveraged by the Web3Auth SDK, which handles all the callbacks by itself and the user just needs
to set the `AuthAdapter` and connect to the Web3Auth SDK, adding the AWS Cognito `client_id` in it.
Hence, this is the implicit flow and is the most suitable flow for setting up your authentication
via AWS Cognito and Web3Auth.

In the **Authorization code** flow, you have to spin up a server on your own where you'll receive
the `authorisation code` from AWS Cognito. For Web3Auth, still requires an `id_token` to be sent to
the AuthAdapter to log the user in the frontend context. This is where you need to make another call
from the backend server to AWS Cognito to get the `id_token` and pass it over to your frontend where
you can send it to the Web3Auth SDK.

### Setting up your application with Authorization code Flow

- In addition to the steps above, select `Authorization code grant` from **Allowed OAuth Flows** on
  your AWS Cognito Console's App client settings page and add callback URLs for both your backend
  and frontend
- On the frontend, your login button should hit on the following URL

```url
https://{YOUR_DOMAIN}.auth.{region}.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize?
  response_type=code&
  client_id={CLIENT_ID_FROM_AWS}&
  redirect_uri=https://{YOUR_APP}/redirect_uri&
  state=STATE&
  scope=openid+profile+aws.cognito.signin.user.admin
```

- This is where the user is redirected to a login screen by AWS Cognito.
- On successful login, the user will be redirected to your backend server with authorization `code`
  as a query parameter.
- In the backend server, you can use the `code` to get the `id_token` from AWS Cognito and redirect
  the user to the frontend with `id_token` as a query parameter

```tsx
app.get('/callback', (req, res) => {
  var options = {
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'https://{YOUR_DOMAIN}.auth.{REGION}.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token',
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
      'Authorization': 'Basic ' + Buffer.from(CLIENT_ID_FROM_AWS + ':' + CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_AWS).toString('base64')
     },
    form:{
      grant_type: 'authorization_code',
      client_id: 'CLIENT_ID_FROM_AWS',
      code: req.query.code, // the authorisation code you got from AWS Cognito
      redirect_uri: 'https://{YOUR_FRONTEND_URL}',
    }
   };

   var id_token = "";

   request(options, function (error, response, data) {
    id_token = JSON.parse(data)["id_token"];
    redirect_url = "http://{YOUR_FRONTEND_URL}?token=%22+id_token;
    // Redirection URL to frontend with `id_token` as a query parameter
    res.redirect(redirect_url);
  });
})
```

- In the frontend, pass on this `id_token` to the Web3Auth SDK to authenticate the user

```tsx
await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.AUTH, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    id_token: "YOUR_ID_TOKEN_FETCHED_FROM_BACKEND_SERVER",
    domain: "https://YOUR-AWS-COGNITO-DOMAIN",
    verifierIdField: "sub",
  },
});
```
