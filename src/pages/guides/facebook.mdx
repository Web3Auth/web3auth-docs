This guide will cover the basics of how to set up your Web3Auth SDK and Facebook Login for the
custom authentication and provide you the steps on how to develop a basic web application on the
Ethereum blockchain.

**Live Demo:** https://web3auth-core-facebook-demo.vercel.app

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/web-no-modal-sdk/custom-authentication/single-verifier-examples/facebook-no-modal-example w3a-facebook-demo && cd w3a-facebook-demo && npm install && npm run start
```

## How it works?

When integrating Web3Auth with Facebook Login the flow looks something like this:

![Web3Auth Core - Facebook Login Flow](/images/implicit-flow.svg)

- When a user logs in with `Facebook`, Facebook sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is
  sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for
  the user, in a self custodial way, resulting in easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Prerequisites

<Web3AuthPrerequisites />

- A [Facebook Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) account to
  be used as Login provider for Web3Auth Custom Authentication.

## Setup

### Setup your Facebook App

1. Follow Facebook's instruction to
   [create a new app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app).
2. When creating an app, make sure to select `Consumer` from this screen to use Facebook Login.
   ![Facebook OAuth2.0 App Dashboard](/guides/social-providers/facebook/facebook-app.png)

3. On the next screen, you'll be presented with different products you can integrate into your
   Facebook app. Click **"Set Up"** in the card representing the **Facebook Login** capability.

   ![Facebook OAuth2.0 App Dashboard](/guides/social-providers/facebook/facebook-login-setup.png)

4. Paste the following as Redirect URI into the "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs" field.

   - https://auth.web3auth.io/auth (for Web3Auth mainnet used in production applications)

   ![Facebook OAuth2.0 App Dashboard](/guides/social-providers/facebook/facebook-login-settings-oauth.png)

5. Obtain the "App ID" and "App Secret" from the **Settings > Basic** screen.

   ![Facebook OAuth2.0 App Dashboard](/guides/social-providers/facebook/facebook-app-id-secret.png)

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

- Create a **Verifier** from the **Custom Auth** Section of the
  [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) with following configuration:

  - Choose a name of your choice for the verifier identifier. `eg. facebook-core-verifier`
  - Select environment: `testnet`, `mainnet`, `aqua`, or `cyan` as per your requirement.
  - Select `Facebook` from the **Login Provider**.
    ![Facebook - Login Providers list on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/login-providers-list.png)
  - Paste the **App ID** and **App Secret** from the Facebook App(above) to the `Client ID` and
    `Client Secret` field respectively.
    ![Facebook Client ID on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/facebook-verifier.png)
  - Click on `Create` button to create your verifier. It may take up to 10 minutes to deploy
    verifier on _testnet_. You'll receive an email once it's complete.

- You will require the `verifierName` of the newly created verifier and `clientId` of the Plug and
  Play Project.

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth
to your project. To know more about the available SDKs, please have a look at this
[documentation page](/sdk).

For this guide here, we will be talking through the
[Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) and using the
[Auth Adapter](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth) alongside it to enable Custom Authentication through
Facebook Login.

### Installation

<Installation />

### Initialization

<InitializationIntro />

For this guide, we're only focusing on the Instantiation, Configuration for the Auth Adapter (the
default adapter that enables social logins) and Initialization of the Web3Auth SDK. To know more
about the other things you can do with Web3Auth, checkout our
[SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal).

#### Instantiating Web3Auth

<InstantiationWeb3Auth />

#### Initializing the Auth Adapter

<AuthConfigCodeFacebook />

Here, you need to pass over your Web3Auth `clientId` in the adapterSettings object and your Custom
Auth `verifierName` and AWS Cognito `clientId` in the loginConfig object. This makes sure that the
Auth Adapter can connect to the correct verifier and AWS Cognito server.

<InitializationWeb3Auth />

### Authentication

#### Logging in

Once initialized, you can use the `connectTo()` function to authenticate the user when they click
the login button.

```tsx
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.AUTH, {
  loginProvider: "facebook",
});
```

When connecting, your `connectTo` function takes the arguments for the adapter you want to connect
to and the `loginProvider` for the login.

### Get the User Profile

```tsx
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

Using the `getUserInfo` function, you can get the details of the logged in user. Please note that
these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth network, but are fetched from the id_token you
received from AWS Cognito and lives in the frontend context.

### Logout

```tsx
await web3auth.logout();
```

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.

### Interacting with Blockchain

## Example code

The code for the application we developed in this guide can be found in the
[Web3Auth Core Facebook Login Example](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/tree/main/web-no-modal-sdk/custom-authentication/single-verifier-examples/facebook-no-modal-example).
Check it out and try running it locally yourself!
