This guide will cover the basics of how to use the Web3Auth React Native SDK in your React Native
application.

**Live Demo:** [Android](https://w3a.link/react-native-auth0-example)
[iOS](https://w3a.link/react-native-auth0-ios-example)

Repository:
https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/tree/main/react-native/rn-bare-auth0-example

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/react-native/rn-bare-auth0-example w3a-rb-bare-auth0-demo && cd w3a-rb-bare-auth0-demo && npm install
```

```bash
# For Android
npm run android
# For iOS
cd ios && pod install && cd .. && npm run ios
```

## How it works?

When integrating Web3Auth React Native SDK with Auth0 the flow looks something like this:

![Auth0 SPA Flow](/guides/auth0/auth0-spa-flow.png)

- When a user logs in with `Auth0`, Auth0 sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is sent
  to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for
  the user, in a self-custodial way, resulting in easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Prerequisites

<Web3AuthPrerequisites />

<RNBarePreRequisites />

<Auth0Prerequisites />

## Setup

### Setup your Auth0 Tenant

<Auth0Setup />

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

### Create Auth0 Verifiers

<Auth0VerifierSetup />

- Add `{YOUR_APP_SCHEME}://auth` in the **Whitelist URL** field of the Web3Auth Dashboard.

### Configure Deep Link

<Tabs
  defaultValue="android"
  values={[
    { label: "Android", value: "android" },
    { label: "iOS", value: "ios" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="android">

<RNAndroidConfig />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ios">

- Make sure that the minimum SDK compile version in `Podfile` is 14 or more.

```Podfile title="ios/Podfile"
platform :ios, '14'
```

- Install the Cocoa Pods within your project directory.

```shell
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

- In iOS, you don't need to add `redirectUrl` as an iOS Custom URL Scheme, however, you may add it
  to your `Info.plist`, but it is not required. Make sure your `redirectUrl` is registered in the
  [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth
to your project. To know more about the available SDKs, please have a look at this
[documentation page](/sdk).

For this guide, we will be talking through the [Web3Auth React Native SDK](/sdk/pnp/react-native).

### Installation

##### [`@web3auth/react-native-sdk`](https://github.com/web3auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/react-native-sdk
```

### Adding a Web Browser Module

We will also require a `WebBrowser` implementation to allow our JS-based SDK to interact with the
native APIs, and different extra installation steps depending on whether you are using the bare
workflow or managed workflow. Since we're using the SDK with a bare workflow React Native app, you
have to install a `WebBrowser` implementation made by us as a porn from the Expo Web Browser Module.

##### [`@toruslabs/react-native-web-browser`](https://github.com/torusresearch/react-native-web-browser)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @toruslabs/react-native-web-browser
```

### Adding an `EncryptedStorage` Module

We will also require an `EncryptedStorage` implementation to allow for session management without
storing the private key on the device.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save react-native-encrypted-storage
```

### Initialization

After Installation, the next step to use Web3Auth is to Initialize the SDK. The Initialization is a
two-step process,

- [Importing Required Packages](/sdk/pnp/react-native/initialize#importing-required-packages)
- [Instantiating Web3Auth](#instantiating-web3auth)

Please note that these are the most critical steps where you need to pass on different parameters
according to the preference of your project. Additionally, Whitelabeling and Custom Authentication
have to be configured within this step, if you wish to customize your Web3Auth Instance.

#### Importing `Web3Auth`

You may also import additional types from the SDK to help in the development process.

```typescript
import Web3Auth, { LOGIN_PROVIDER, OPENLOGIN_NETWORK } from "@web3auth/react-native-sdk";
```

#### Importing a `WebBrowser` implementation

```typescript
import * as WebBrowser from "@toruslabs/react-native-web-browser";
```

#### Importing a `EncryptedStorage` implementation

```typescript
import EncryptedStorage from "react-native-encrypted-storage";
```

#### Instantiating Web3Auth

It's time to create an instance of Web3Auth in the project.

We need `clientId` and target Web3Auth `network` to initialize the `web3auth` object.

- You can get your `clientId` from registering (above) on the Developer Dashboard.

- `network` signifies the network on which the deployed Web3Auth nodes are running. For testing
  purposes, we have a `Sapphire Devnet` network. For production usage, you can use the
  `Sapphire Mainnet` network.

```tsx
const web3auth = new Web3Auth(WebBrowser, EncryptedStorage, {
  clientId,
  network: OPENLOGIN_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET, // SAPPHIRE_MAINNET or SAPPHIRE_DEVNET
  loginConfig: {
    // Add login configs corresponding to the provider
    // Auth0 login works with jwt login config
    jwt: {
      verifier: "YOUR_AUTH0_VERIFIER_NAME", // Please create a verifier on the developer dashboard and pass the name here
      typeOfLogin: "jwt",
      clientId: "AUTH0_CLIENT_ID_123ABcdefg4HiJKlMno4P5QR6stUvWXY", // use your app client id you got from auth0
    },
    // Add other login providers here
  },
});
```

### Authentication

#### Logging in

Once initialized, you can use the `login` function of `web3auth` to navigate the user to the login
process. For each login method, you have to select the `loginProvider` such as `google`, `facebook`,
`twitch`, `jwt`, `email_passwordless` etc.

:::info JWT

If you are using custom authentication through **Auth0 or Custom JWT**, you have to use the `JWT`
login provider.

Additionally, in `extraLoginOptions` you have to provide the details required by that specific
method as mentioned here.

:::

Once a user logs in, the user can access the key by `web3auth.privKey()`. For EVM Blockchains, the
`secp256k1` private key is used to sign transactions. We can get an `ed25519` compatible private key
for other blockchains using `web3auth.ed25519Key()`.

```tsx
await web3auth.login({
  redirectUrl: resolvedRedirectUrl,
  mfaLevel: "default", // Pass on the MFA level of your choice: default, optional, mandatory, none
  // Auth0 login works with JWT loginProvider
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    domain: "https://YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN", // Please append "https://" before your domain
    verifierIdField: "sub", // For SMS & Email Passwordless, use "name" as verifierIdField
  },
});
```

- [Using dApp Share](/sdk/pnp/react-native/dapp-share)

### Get the User Profile

```tsx
// Assuming the user is logged in, get the user profile from the web3auth object
var userInfo = web3auth.userInfo();
```

#### Sample userInfo

<ReactNativeResponse />

Using the `web3Auth.login()` function, you can get the details of the logged-in user. Please note
that these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth network.

### Logout

Use the `logout` function of `web3auth` to log the user out.

```tsx
web3auth.logout();
```

:::info SDK Reference

- [`logout()` function](/sdk/pnp/react-native/usage#logging-out-a-user).

## Interacting with the Blockchain

Once a user logs in, the user can access the private key by `web3auth.privKey()`. For EVM
Blockchains, the `secp256k1` private key is used to sign transactions. We can get an `ed25519`
compatible private key for other blockchains using `web3auth.ed25519Key()`. Similar to how we're
using this private key in the `ethers.js` library in this example, you can connect to any other
blockchain of your choice.

:::info connect any blockchain

Please go through the [Connect Blockchain](/connect-blockchain/evm/ethereum/react-native)
Documentation, which contains all the details of the EVM-based blockchain you have selected here.
