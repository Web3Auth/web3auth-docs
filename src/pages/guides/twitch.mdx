This guide will cover the basics of how to set up your Web3Auth SDK and Twitch Login for custom
authentication and provide you the steps on how to develop a basic web application on the Ethereum
blockchain.

**Live Demo:** https://web3auth-core-twitch-demo.vercel.app

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/web-no-modal-sdk/custom-authentication/single-verifier-examples/twitch-no-modal-example w3a-twitch-demo && cd w3a-twitch-demo && npm install && npm run start
```

## How it works?

When integrating Web3Auth with Twitch Login the flow looks something like this:

![Web3Auth Core - Twitch Login Flow](/images/implicit-flow.svg)

- When a user logs in with `Twitch`, Twitch sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is
  sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for
  the user, in a self-custodial way, resulting in easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Prerequisites

<Web3AuthPrerequisites />

- A [Twitch Developer](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create) account to be used as Login
  provider for Web3Auth Custom Authentication.

## Setup

### Setup your Twitch App

<SetupTwitch />

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

- Create a **Verifier** from the **Custom Authentication** tab of your Web3Auth project with the
  following configuration:

  - Choose a name of your choice for the verifier identifier. `eg. web3auth-twitch-demo`
  - Select environment: `sapphire_devnet`, or `sapphire_mainnet` as per your requirement.
  - Select `Twitch` from the **Login Provider**.

  - Paste the **Client ID** from the Twitch App(above) to the `Client ID` field.
    ![Twitch Client ID on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/dashboard/create-verifier-twitch.png)
  - Click on the `Create` button to create your verifier. It may take up to 10 minutes to deploy the
    verifier. You'll receive an email once it's complete.

- You will require the `verifierName` of the newly created verifier and `clientId` of the Plug and
  Play Project.

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth
to your project. To know more about the available SDKs, please have a look at this
[documentation page](/sdk).

For this guide, we will be talking through the
[Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) and using the
[Auth Adapter](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth) alongside it to enable Custom Authentication through
Twitch Login.

### Installation

<Installation />

### Initialization

<InitializationIntro />

For this guide, we're only focusing on the Instantiation, Configuration for the Auth Adapter (the
default adapter that enables social logins) and Initialization of the Web3Auth SDK. To know more
about the other things you can do with Web3Auth, checkout our
[SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal).

#### Instantiating Web3Auth

<InstantiationWeb3Auth />

#### Initializing the Auth Adapter

<AuthConfigCodeTwitch />

Here, you need to pass over your Web3Auth `clientId` in the adapterSettings object and your Custom
Auth `verifierName` and AWS Cognito `clientId` in the loginConfig object. This makes sure that the
Auth Adapter can connect to the correct verifier and AWS Cognito server.

<InitializationWeb3Auth />

### Authentication

#### Logging in

Once initialized, you can use the `connectTo()` function to authenticate the user when they click
the login button.

```tsx
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.AUTH, {
  loginProvider: "twitch",
});
```

When connecting, your `connectTo` function takes the arguments for the adapter you want to connect
to and the `loginProvider` for the login.

### Get the User Profile

```tsx
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

Using the `getUserInfo` function, you can get the details of the logged in user. Please note that
these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth network, but are fetched from the id_token you
received from AWS Cognito and lives in the frontend context.

### Logout

```tsx
await web3auth.logout();
```

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.

## Example code

The code for the application we developed in this guide can be found in the
[Web3Auth Core Twitch Login Example](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/tree/main/web-no-modal-sdk/custom-authentication/single-verifier-examples/twitch-no-modal-example).
Check it out and try running it locally yourself!
