This guide will cover the basics of how to set up your Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK and Auth0
account for the integration and provide you with the links on how to develop a basic web application
on the blockchain of your choice.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/web-no-modal-sdk/custom-authentication/single-verifier-examples/auth0-no-modal-example w3a-auth0-demo && cd w3a-auth0-demo && npm install && npm run start
```

## How it works?

<Tabs
defaultValue="spa"
values={[
  { label: "Single Page Applications (SPA) Flow", value: "spa" },
  { label: "Regular Web Applications (RWA) Flow", value: "rwa" },
]}
>
<TabItem value="spa">

When integrating Web3Auth with Auth0 SPA the flow looks something like this:

![Auth0 SPA Flow](/guides/auth0/auth0-spa-flow.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rwa">

When integrating Web3Auth with Auth0 RWA, we need an additional backend server to communicate with
Auth0. The flow looks something like this:

![Auth0 RWA Flow](/guides/auth0/auth0-rwa-flow.png)

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

- When a user logs in with Auth0, Auth0 sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is sent to
  the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for
  the user, in a self-custodial way, resulting in easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Using the Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK

To use the Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective
platform SDK of Web3Auth to your project. To know more about the available SDKs, please have a look
at this [documentation page](/sdk).

For this guide, we will be talking through the
[Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) and using the
[Auth Adapter](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth) alongside it to enable Custom Authentication through
Auth0.

### Installation

<Installation />

### Initialization

<InitializationIntro />

For this guide, we're only focusing on the Instantiation, Configuration for the Auth Adapter (the
default adapter that enables social logins) and Initialization of the Web3Auth SDK. To know more
about the other things you can do with Web3Auth, check out our
[SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal).

#### Instantiating Web3Auth

<InstantiationWeb3Auth />

#### Initializing the Auth Adapter

<AuthConfigCode />

Here, you need to pass over your Web3Auth `clientId` in the adapterSettings object and your Custom
Auth `verifierName` and Auth0 `clientId` in the `loginConfig` object. This makes sure that the Auth
Adapter can connect to the correct verifier and Auth0 server.

<InitializationWeb3Auth />

### Login

Once initialized, you can use the `connectTo()` function to authenticate the user when they click
the login button.

<Tabs
defaultValue="social"
values={[
  { label: "Social Logins", value: "social" },
  { label: "SMS Passwordless Login", value: "sms" },
  { label: "Email Passwordless Login", value: "email" },
]}
>
<TabItem value="social">

```tsx
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.AUTH, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    domain: "https://web3auth.au.auth0.com", // Please append "https://" before your domain
    verifierIdField: "sub", // For SMS & Email Passwordless, use "name" as verifierIdField
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sms">

```tsx
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.AUTH, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    domain: "https://web3auth.au.auth0.com", // Please append "https://" before your domain
    verifierIdField: "name",
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="email">

```tsx
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.AUTH, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    domain: "https://web3auth.au.auth0.com", // Please append "https://" before your domain
    verifierIdField: "name",
  },
});
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

When connecting, your `connectTo` function takes the arguments for the adapter you want to connect
to and the options for the login. The major thing to note here is the `domain` option in the
`extraLoginOptions` object. This is the domain of your Auth0 tenant so that you can be redirected to
login there directly from the Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK.

### Get the User Profile

```tsx
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

Using the `getUserInfo` function, you can get the details of the logged-in user. Please note that
these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth network, but are fetched from the id_token you
received from Auth0 and live in the frontend context.

### Logout

```tsx
await web3auth.logout();
```

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.

### Difference between SPA and RWA

In the SPA flow, the frontend gets the JWT `id_token` from Auth0 directly. This flow is leveraged by
the Web3Auth SDK, which handles all the callbacks by itself and the user just needs to set up the
`AuthAdapter` and connect to the Web3Auth SDK, adding in the Auth0 `client_id` in it. Hence, this is
the implicit flow and is the most suitable flow for setting up your authentication via Auth0 and
Web3Auth.

In the RWA flow, you have to spin up a server on your own where you'll receive the authorization
code from Auth0. Web3Auth still requires an `id_token` to be sent to the AuthAdapter to log the user
in the frontend context. This is where you need to make another call from the backend server to
Auth0 to get the `id_token` and pass it over to your frontend where you can send it to the Web3Auth
SDK.

### Setting up your application with RWA Flow

- In addition to the steps above, set up your Auth0 RWA on the dashboard and add callback URLs for
  both your backend and frontend
- On the frontend, your login button should hit on the following URL

```url
https://{YOUR_DOMAIN_URL}/authorize?scope=openid&response_type=code&client_id={YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri={YOUR_BACKEND_SERVER_WHICH_WILL_GET_JWT_TOKEN_FROM_AUTH0}&state=STATE
```

- This is where the user is redirected to a login screen by Auth0.
- On successful login, the user will be redirected to your backend server with authorization `code`
  as a query parameter.
- In the backend server, you can use the `code` to get the `id_token` from Auth0 and redirect the
  user to the frontend with `id_token` as a query parameter

```tsx
app.get('/callback', (req, res) => {
  var options = {
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'https://{YOUR_DOMAIN_URL}/oauth/token',
    headers: { 'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
    form:{
      grant_type: 'authorization_code',
      client_id: 'AUTH0_CLIENT_ID',
      client_secret: 'AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET',
      code: req.query.code, // the authorization code you got from auth0
      redirect_uri: 'https://{YOUR_FRONTEND_URL}',
      scope: "openid profile email"
    }
   };

   var id_token = "";

   request(options, function (error, response, data) {
    id_token = JSON.parse(data)["id_token"];
    redirect_url = "http://{YOUR_FRONTEND_URL}?token=%22+id_token;
    // Redirection URL to frontend with `id_token` as a query parameter
    res.redirect(redirect_url);
  });
})
```

- In the frontend, pass on this `id_token` to the Web3Auth SDK to authenticate the user

```tsx
await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.AUTH, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    id_token: "YOUR_ID_TOKEN_FETCHED_FROM_BACKEND_SERVER",
    verifierIdField: "sub",
  },
});
```

## Try our Demo Application and Example Code

Try our example app with Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK & Auth0 integration. It works for
either Ethereum, Solana or Polygon. It also works for both flows, ie. SPA and RWA. The source code
for the demo application is available
[here](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/tree/main/web-no-modal-sdk/custom-authentication/single-verifier-examples/auth0-no-modal-example).

The code for the application we developed in this guide can be found in the
[Web3Auth Auth0 Example](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/tree/main/web-no-modal-sdk/custom-authentication/single-verifier-examples/auth0-no-modal-example).
Check it out and try running it locally yourself!
