This guide will cover the basics of how to set up your Web3Auth SDK and Auth0 account for the integration and provide you with the links on how to
develop a basic web application on the blockchain of your choice. Before starting, you can try the demo integration in our example
[here](https://demo-auth0.web3auth.io).

## Quick Start

---

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Web3Auth/examples.git
cd auth0-react-example
npm install
npm run start
```

## How it works?

---

<Tabs
defaultValue="spa"
values={[
  { label: "Single Page Applications (SPA) Flow", value: "spa" },
  { label: "Regular Web Applications (RWA) Flow", value: "rwa" },
]}
>
<TabItem value="spa">

When integrating Web3Auth with Auth0 SPA the flow looks something like this:

![Auth0 SPA Flow](/contents/guides/auth0/auth0-spa-flow.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rwa">

When integrating Web3Auth with Auth0 RWA, we need an additional backend server to communicate with Auth0. The flow looks something like this:

![Auth0 RWA Flow](/contents/guides/auth0/auth0-rwa-flow.png)

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

- When a user logs in with Auth0, Auth0 sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for the user, in a self custodial way, resulting in
  easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Prerequisites

---

<Web3AuthPrerequisites />

- Create an Auth0 tenant and configure a Single Page Web Application (SPA for Web) or Native (for Mobile) from
  [Auth0 Console](https://manage.auth0.com/).

  - Please note that Regular Web Applications are also supported as mentioned in the flows above. However for this guide, we’re preferring SPA since
    its implicit flow doesn’t require an application to host a backend server. You can navigate to the
    [additional section](#additional-reading-setup-custom-authentication-using-auth0-rwa) below which talks about the code flow with RWA.

## Setup

---

### Setup your Auth0 Tenant

- Add the following URLs for your app to the Allowed Web Origins field when configuring your Auth0 Application.

  - Additional to your own URLs for the application, please add
    - [https://beta.openlogin.com/auth](https://beta.openlogin.com/auth) (for Web3Auth testnet used in demo applications) and
    - [https://app.openlogin.com/auth](https://app.openlogin.com/auth) (for Web3Auth mainnet used in production applications).

  ![Add Callback URL to Auth0 Dashboard](/contents/guides/auth0/auth0-callback-url.png)

- You will require `domain` and `clientId` of the newly created application which you can copy from [Auth0 Console](https://manage.auth0.com/).
  ![Domain and Client ID from Auth0 Dashboard](/contents/guides/auth0/auth0-guide-clientid.png)

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

- Create a Verifier from the **Custom Auth** Section of the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) with following
  configuration:

  - Choose a name of your choice for the verifier identifier. `eg. auth0-project`
  - Select `Auth0` from the **Login Provider**.
  - Choose your Authentication Type as the Auth Provider you've selected.
  - Paste the `clientId` and `domain` from the Auth0 SPA you created in the above steps. This will be used to validate the JWT token issued by Auth0.
  - Click on `Create` button to create your verifier. It may take up to 10 minutes to deploy verifier on _testnet_. You'll receive an email once it's
    complete.
    <img style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "500px", margin: "20px auto" }} src={Image3} />

- You will require the `verifierName` of the newly created verifier and `clientId` of the Plug and Play Project.

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

---

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth to your project. To know more about the available
SDKs, please have a look at this [documentation page](/get-started/understand-sdk).

For this guide here, we will be talking through the [Web3Auth Plug and Play Core SDK](/api-reference/web/core) and using the
[OpenLogin Provider](/api-reference/web/openlogin) alongside it to enable Custom Authentication through Auth0.

### Installation

<Installation />

### Initialization

<InitializationIntro />

For this guide, we're only focusing on the Instantiation, Configuration for the Openlogin Adapter (the default adapter that enables social logins) and
Initialization of the Web3Auth SDK. To know more about the other things you can do with Web3Auth, checkout our
[API Reference](/api-reference/web/core).

#### Instantiating Web3Auth

<InstantiationWeb3Auth />

#### Initialising the Openlogin Adapter

<OpenloginConfigCode />

Here, you need to pass over your Web3Auth `clientId` in the adapterSettings object and your Custom Auth `verifierName` and Auth0 `clientId` in the
loginConfig object. This makes sure that the Openlogin Adapter can connect to the correct verifier and Auth0 server.

<InitializationWeb3Auth />

### Authentication

#### Logging in

Once initialized, you can use the `connectTo()` function to authenticate the user when they click the login button.

```js
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    domain: "https://YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN", // Please append "https://" before your domain
    verifierIdField: "sub",
  },
});
```

When connecting, your `connectTo` function takes the arguments for the adapter you want to connect to and the options for the login. The major thing
to note here is the `domain` option in the `extraLoginOptions` object. This is the domain of your Auth0 tenant so that you can be redirected to login
there directly from the Web3Auth Plug and Play Core SDK.

### Get the User Profile

```js
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

Using the `getUserInfo` function, you can get the details of the logged in user. Please note that these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth
network, but are fetched from the id_token you received from Auth0 and lives in the frontend context.

### Logout

```js
await web3auth.logout();
```

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.

### Difference between SPA and RWA

In the SPA flow, the frontend gets the JWT `id_token` from Auth0 directly. This flow is leveraged by the Web3Auth SDK, which handles all the callbacks
by itself and the user just needs to setup the `OpenloginAdapter` and connect to the Web3Auth SDK, adding in the Auth0 `client_id` in it. Hence, this
is the implicit flow and is the most suitable flow for setting up your authentication via Auth0 and Web3Auth.

In the RWA flow, you have to spin up a server on your own where you'll receive the authorisation code from Auth0. For Web3Auth, still require an
`id_token` to be sent to the OpenloginAdapter to log the user in the frontend context. This is where you need to make another call from the backend
server to Auth0 to get the `id_token` and pass it over to your frontend where you can send it to the Web3Auth SDK.

### Setting up your application with RWA Flow

- In addition to the steps above, setup your Auth0 RWA on dashboard and add callback URLs for both your backend and frontend
- On the frontend, you login button should hit on the following URL

```url
https://{YOUR_DOMAIN_URL}/authorize?scope=openid&response_type=code&client_id={YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri={YOUR_BACKEND_SERVER_WHICH_WILL_GET_JWT_TOKEN_FROM_AUTH0}&state=STATE
```

- This is where the user is redirected to a login screen by Auth0.
- On successful login, the user will be redirected to your backend server with authorization `code` as a query parameter.
- In the backend server, you can use the `code` to get the `id_token` from Auth0 and redirect the user to the frontend with `id_token` as a query
  parameter

```js
app.get('/callback', (req, res) => {
  var options = {
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'https://{YOUR_DOMAIN_URL}/oauth/token',
    headers: { 'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
    form:{
      grant_type: 'authorization_code',
      client_id: 'AUTH0_CLIENT_ID',
      client_secret: 'AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET',
      code: req.query.code, // the authorisation code you got from auth0
      redirect_uri: 'https://{YOUR_FRONTEND_URL}',
      scope: "openid profile email"
    }
   };

   var id_token = "";

   request(options, function (error, response, data) {
    id_token = JSON.parse(data)["id_token"];
    redirect_url = "http://{YOUR_FRONTEND_URL}?token=%22+id_token; // Redirection URL to frontend with `id_token` as a query parameter
    res.redirect(redirect_url);
  });
})
```

- In the frontend, pass on this `id_token` to the Web3Auth SDK to authenticate the user

```js
await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    id_token: "YOUR_ID_TOKEN_FETCHED_FROM_BACKEND_SERVER",
    domain: "https://YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN",
    verifierIdField: "sub",
  },
});
```
