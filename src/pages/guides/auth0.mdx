This guide will cover the basics of how to set up your Web3Auth SDK and Auth0 account for the integration and provide you with the links on how to
develop a basic web application on the blockchain of your choice. Before starting, you can try the demo integration in our example
[here](https://demo-auth0.web3auth.io).

## How it works?

---

When integrating Web3Auth with Auth0 SPA the flow looks something like this:

![Auth0 SPA Flow](/contents/guides/auth0/auth0-spa-flow.png)

For Auth0 RWA, we need an additional backend server to communicate with Auth0. The flow for RWA with Web3Auth looks something like this:

![Auth0 RWA Flow](/contents/guides/auth0/auth0-rwa-flow.png)

- When a user logs in with Auth0, Auth0 sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for the user, in a self custodial way, resulting in
  easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Prerequisites

---

- For Web Apps: A basic knowledge of JavaScript is required to use Web3Auth SDK.

- For Mobile Apps: For the Web3Auth Mobile SDKs, you have a choice between iOS, Android, React Native & Flutter. Please refer to the
  [Web3Auth API Reference](/api-reference) for more information.

- Create an Auth0 tenant and configure a Single Page Web Application (SPA for Web) or Native (for Mobile) from
  [Auth0 Console](https://manage.auth0.com/).

  - Please note that Regular Web Applications are also supported, however for this guide, we’re preferring SPA since its implicit flow doesn’t require
    an application to host a server. You can navigate to the [additional section](#additional-reading-setup-custom-authentication-using-auth0-rwa)
    below which talks about the code flow with RWA.

- Create a Web3Auth account on the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io)

## Setup

---

### Setup your Auth0 Tenant

- Add the following URLs for your app to the Allowed Web Origins field when configuring your Auth0 Application.

  - Additional to your own URLs for the application, please add
    - [https://beta.openlogin.com/auth](https://beta.openlogin.com/auth) (for Web3Auth testnet used in demo applications) and
    - [https://app.openlogin.com/auth](https://app.openlogin.com/auth) (for Web3Auth mainnet used in production applications).

  ![Add Callback URL to Auth0 Dashboard](/contents/guides/auth0/auth0-callback-url.png)

- You will require `domain` and `clientId` of the newly created application which you can copy from [Auth0 Console](https://manage.auth0.com/).
  ![Domain and Client ID from Auth0 Dashboard](/contents/guides/auth0/auth0-guide-clientid.png)

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

- Create a Project from the **Plug and Play** Section of the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/).

  <img style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "600px", margin: "20px auto" }} src={Image1} />

  - Enter your desired Project name
  - Select the blockchain(s) you'll be building this project on. For interoperability with Torus Wallet, you've an option of allowing the user's
    private key to be used in other applications using Torus Wallet. We currently have this option across `EVM` and `Solana` and `Casper` blockchains.

  - Finally, once you create the project, you've the option to whitelist your URLs for the project. Please whitelist the domains where your project
    will be hosted.
    <img style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "400px", margin: "20px auto" }} src={Image2} />

- Create a Verifier from the **Custom Auth** Section of the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) with following
  configuration:

  - Choose a name of your choice for the verifier identifier.
  - Select verifier type as `Auth0`
  - Choose your Authentication Type as the Auth Provider you've selected.
  - Paste the `clientId` and `domain` from the Auth0 SPA you create in the above steps. This will be used to validate the JWT token issued by Auth0.
    <img style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "500px", margin: "20px auto" }} src={Image3} />

- You will require the `verifierName` of the newly created verifier and `clientId` of the Plug and Play Project.

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

---

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth to your project. To know more about the available
SDKs, please have a look at this [documentation page](/developing-with-web3auth/understand-sdk).

For this guide here, we will be talking through the [Web3Auth Core SDK](/api-reference/web/core) and using the
[OpenLogin Provider](/api-reference/web/adapters/openlogin) alongside it to enable Custom Authentication through Auth0.

#### Setting up your base project for using Web3 libraries:​

If you are starting from scratch, to set up this project locally, you will need to create a base Web application, where you can install the required
dependencies. However, while working with Web3, there are a few base libraries, which need additional configuration. This is because certain packages
are not available in the browser environment, and we need to polyfill them manually. You can follow
[this documentation](https://docs.web3auth.io/troubleshooting/webpack-issues) where we have mentioned the configuration changes for some popular
frameworks for your reference.

### Installation

For this project, you need to add the following Web3Auth dependencies to your package.json

#### Web3Auth Dependencies

##### `@web3auth/core`

This is the main **Core** package that contains the Web3Auth SDK.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/core
```

##### `@web3auth/openlogin-adapter`

For using Custom Authentication, we need to use the **OpenLogin Adapter**, where we can initialise the authentication details.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/openlogin-adapter
```

##### `@web3auth/base`

Since we're using typescript, we need the **`@web3auth/base`** package to provide types of the different variables we'll be using throughout the app
building process. This reduces errors to a very large extent.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

#### Web3 Libraries

##### `web3`/ `ethers`/ `@solana/web3.js`

According to your preference, you can choose to install the `web3` or `ethers` libraries, to talk to the EVM compatible blockchains under the hood.
For Solana, `@solana/web3.js` is the recommended choice.

We'll be using `web3` for this guide.

```shell
npm install --save @web3
```

### Initialization

Once installed, your Web3Auth application needs to be initialized. Initialisation is a multi step process where we add all the config details for
Web3Auth and OpenloginAdapter. Please make sure all of this is happening when the component mounts in your application using `useEffect` hook. This
makes sure that Web3Auth is initialised when your application starts up.

#### Importing the packages

```js
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES, SafeEventEmitterProvider } from "@web3auth/base";
import { Web3AuthCore } from "@web3auth/core";
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter";
```

Alongside the `Web3Auth` and `OpenloginAdapter` you need the abovementioned packages from `@web3auth/base` for different initialisations mentioned
further in this guide.

#### Setting up the Web3Auth SDK

```js
import { Web3AuthCore } from "@web3auth/core";
import { CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

const web3auth = new Web3AuthCore({
  chainConfig: {
    chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155,
    chainId: "0x1",
  },
});
```

Here, we're using the `chainConfig` property to set the chainId and chainNamespace. The `chainId` and `chainNamespace` are the id and the namespace
respectively of the chain you're connecting to. We've initialised them for EVM for this guide. You can find the list of available providers
[here](http://localhost:3000/api-reference/web/providers/) to select from.

Additionally, sometimes you might face clogging in the network, due to the fact that the test network is a bit clogged at that point. To avoid this,
we can use the property `rpcTarget` and pass over the url of the node you want to connect to.

#### Initialising the Openlogin Adapter

```js
const openloginAdapter = new OpenloginAdapter({
  adapterSettings: {
    clientId: "YOUR-WEB3AUTH-CLIENT-ID",
    network: "testnet",
    uxMode: "popup",
    loginConfig: {
      jwt: {
        name: "Name of your choice",
        verifier: "YOUR-VERIFIER-NAME-ON-WEB3AUTH-DASHBOARD",
        typeOfLogin: "jwt",
        clientId: "YOUR-CLIENTID-ON-AUTH0-DASHBOARD",
      },
    },
  },
});

web3auth.configureAdapter(openloginAdapter);
```

Here, you need to pass over your Web3Auth `clientId` in the adapterSettings object and your Custom Auth `verifierName` and Auth0 `clientId` in the
loginConfig object. This makes sure that the Openlogin Adapter can connect to the correct verifier and Auth0 server.

#### Initialising the Web3Auth SDK

```js
await web3auth.init();
```

#### Initialising on Mobile Platforms

- For Mobile, depending on the platform, there will be different steps to initialize the SDK. Refer to the respective Mobile SDKs,
  - [Android](/api-reference/android/setting-up)
  - [iOS](/api-reference/ios/setting-up)
  - [Flutter](/api-reference/flutter/setting-up)
  - [React Native](/api-reference/react-native/setting-up).

### Authentication

#### Logging in

Once initialized, you can use the `connectTo()` function to authenticate the user when they click the login button.

```js
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    domain: "https://YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN", // Please append "https://" before your domain
    verifierIdField: "sub",
  },
});
```

When connecting, your `connectTo` function takes the arguments for the adapter you want to connect to and the options for the login. The major thing
to note here is the `domain` option in the `extraLoginOptions` object. This is the domain of your Auth0 tenant so that you can be redirected to login
there directly from the Web3Auth Core SDK.

### Get the User Profile

```js
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

Using the `getUserInfo` function, you can get the details of the logged in user. Please note that these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth
network, but are fetched from the JWT token you received from Auth0 and lives in the frontend context.

### Logout

```js
await web3auth.logout();
```

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.

### Interacting with the Blockchain

So if you have completed this far, it means that you have successfully authenticated your user. Now, you can use the provider returned by Web3Auth as
`web3auth.provider` to interact with your blockchain. You can use the [Provider SDKs](/api-reference/web/providers/) to perform RPC Calls to your
blockchain.

Web3Auth is chain agnostic, ie. depending on whatever blockchain or layer-2 you use, Web3Auth can easily support that. Web3Auth0 has native providers
for EVM and Solana blockchains and for others, you can get the private key in the user scope and make RPC calls. For standardising the type of
provider, Web3Auth Base provides a `SafeEventEmitterProvider` from which you can create your own provider.

- [Ethereum Provider](/api-reference/web/providers/evm) gives you the capability of making RPC calls to the EVM compatible blockchains.
- [Solana Provider](/api-reference/web/providers/solana) gives you the capability of making RPC calls to the Solana blockchain.
- If you want to use any other chain except Solana or EVM chains, for ex: Starknet, you can specify the value of `chainNamespace` field as other in
  the Web3Auth SDK Constructor. Refer to: [Using other blockchains](/api-reference/web/providers/#other)

## Additional Reading: Setup Custom Authentication using Auth0 RWA

---

### Understanding the difference between SPA and RWA Flows

In the SPA flow, the frontend gets the JWT `id_token` from Auth0 directly. This flow is leveraged by the Web3Auth SDK, which handles all the callbacks
by itself and the user just needs to setup the `OpenloginAdapter` and connect to the Web3Auth SDK, adding in the Auth0 `client_id` in it. Hence, this
is the implicit flow and is the most suitable flow for setting up your authentication via Auth0 and Web3Auth.

In the RWA flow, you have to spin up a server on your own where you'll receive the authorisation code from Auth0. For Web3Auth, still require an
`id_token` to be sent to the OpenloginAdapter to log the user in the frontend context. This is where you need to make another call from the backend
server to Auth0 to get the `id_token` and pass it over to your frontend where you can send it to the Web3Auth SDK.

### Setting up your application with RWA Flow

- In addition to the steps above, setup your Auth0 RWA on dashboard and add callback URLs for both your backend and frontend
- On the frontend, you login button should hit on the following URL

```url
https://{YOUR_DOMAIN_URL}/authorize?scope=openid&response_type=code&client_id={YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri={YOUR_BACKEND_SERVER_WHICH_WILL_GET_JWT_TOKEN_FROM_AUTH0}&state=STATE
```

- This is where the user is redirected to a login screen by Auth0.
- On successful login, the user will be redirected to your backend server with authorization `code` as a query parameter.
- In the backend server, you can use the `code` to get the `id_token` from Auth0 and redirect the user to the frontend with `id_token` as a query
  parameter

```js
app.get('/callback', (req, res) => {
  var options = {
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'https://{YOUR_DOMAIN_URL}/oauth/token',
    headers: { 'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
    form:{
      grant_type: 'authorization_code',
      client_id: 'AUTH0_CLIENT_ID',
      client_secret: 'AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET',
      code: req.query.code, // the authorisation code you got from auth0
      redirect_uri: 'https://{YOUR_FRONTEND_URL}',
      scope: "openid profile email"
    }
   };

   var id_token = "";

   request(options, function (error, response, data) {
    id_token = JSON.parse(data)["id_token"];
    redirect_url = "http://{YOUR_FRONTEND_URL}?token=%22+id_token; // Redirection URL to frontend with `id_token` as a query parameter
    res.redirect(redirect_url);
  });
})
```

- In the frontend, pass on this `id_token` to the Web3Auth SDK to authenticate the user

```js
await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    id_token: "YOUR_ID_TOKEN_FETCHED_FROM_BACKEND_SERVER",
    domain: "https://YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN",
    verifierIdField: "sub",
  },
});
```
