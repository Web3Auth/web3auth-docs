Passkeys are an innovative feature that offers a convenient, secure, and passwordless authentication
method, enhancing the user experience while maintaining robust security. Leveraging the WebAuthn
standard, passkeys eliminate the need for traditional passwords, making the authentication process
seamless and user-friendly. Web3Auth supports passkeys through its Single Factor Auth (SFA) Web SDK,
providing a smooth integration for developers.

## Key Benefits of Passkeys

### Convenience

- **Passwordless Login:** Users can authenticate without the need for passwords, reducing friction
  and improving the overall user experience.
- **Biometric Authentication:** Passkeys support biometric methods such as fingerprint or facial
  recognition, offering a quick and secure way to log in.

### Security

- **Phishing Resistant:** Passkeys are inherently phishing-resistant, as they use public-key
  cryptography and are bound to the origin they were created for, making it difficult for attackers
  to intercept or misuse them.
- **Strong Authentication:** Passkeys provide a strong form of authentication, leveraging the
  security features of the user's device.

## How Passkeys Work

### Introduction

Passkeys are a new way of authenticating applications and websites. Instead of having to remember a
password, a third-party service provider (e.g., Google or Apple) generates and stores a
cryptographic key pair that is bound to a website domain. Since you have access to the service
provider, you have access to the keys, which you can then use to log in.

### The Hype: Why Itâ€™s a Game-Changer

- **Easy to Use:** Creating and using passkeys is as simple as consenting to save and use them. No
  need to create a password.
- **Enhanced Security:** Access to passkeys is gated with OS-level biometrics like faceID, touchID,
  and lock screen patterns. Passkeys are bound to the web domain that creates them, preventing
  phishing attacks. They rely on public key cryptography, where private keys are never disclosed to
  websites or apps, making them harder to steal. Only public keys are sent, and to authenticate,
  passkeys sign messages with their private keys, providing signatures as proofs.
- **Automatically Unique Per-Service:** By design, passkeys are unique per-service, eliminating the
  chance of reuse.

### Phases in a Passkeys Flow

- **Attestation:** The registration phase when first signing up for a service, generating a passkey
  instead of an email and password.
- **Assertion:** The login phase after registration, using the generated passkey to authenticate.

### Types of Passkey Credentials

- **Discoverable Credentials:** Self-contained key pairs stored on the end-user's device, easily
  synced and used across devices independently.
- **Non-Discoverable Credentials:** Partially stored on the end-user's device, requiring the
  relaying party to store the generated credential ID.

### OS and Device Support

Almost every modern browser supports passkeys, except Firefox. Support varies by operating system.

## Web3Auth SFA SDK Compatibility

:::info Web3Auth SFA SDK Compatibility

For now, passkeys support is available for the Web3Auth Single Factor Auth (SFA) Web SDK through the
Passkeys SFA Plugin package. Support for additional SDKs is coming soon.

:::

## Installation

To get started, install the Passkeys SFA Plugin using npm:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/passkeys-sfa-plugin
```

## Initialization

Import the `PasskeysPlugin` class from `@web3auth/passkeys-sfa-plugin` and initialize it with the
required options. After creating your Web3Auth SFA instance, you need to initialize the Passkeys
Plugin and add it to the class for further usage.

```javascript
import { PasskeysPlugin } from "@web3auth/passkeys-sfa-plugin";

const passkeysPlugin = new PasskeysPlugin({
  rpID: "your.app.xyz",
  rpName: "Your App",
});

web3auth.addPlugin(passkeysPlugin);
```

## Using Passkeys SFA Plugin

### Registering a New Passkey

Registers a new passkey for the user. The passkey will be saved with the specified username.

```javascript
await passkeysPlugin.registerPasskey({
  username: "user@example.com",
});
```

### Logging in with an Existing Passkey

Logs in the user with an existing passkey.

```javascript
await passkeysPlugin.loginWithPasskey({
  authenticatorId: "authenticator_id",
});
```

### Listing All Registered Passkeys

Lists all passkeys registered for the user.

```javascript
const passkeys = await passkeysPlugin.listAllPasskeys();
console.log(passkeys);
```

## Example Implementation with Web3Auth SFA SDK

To illustrate how to use the Passkeys SFA Plugin with Web3Auth SFA JS SDK, here is a complete
example.

### Setup

First, ensure you have installed the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install --save @web3auth/single-factor-auth @web3auth/passkeys-sfa-plugin
```

### Initialization

Initialize the Web3Auth instance along with the Passkeys Plugin:

```javascript
import { Web3Auth } from "@web3auth/single-factor-auth";
import { EthereumPrivateKeyProvider } from "@web3auth/ethereum-provider";
import { PasskeysPlugin } from "@web3auth/passkeys-sfa-plugin";

const provider = new EthereumPrivateKeyProvider({ config: { chainConfig } });

const web3auth = new Web3Auth({
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  web3AuthNetwork: "sapphire_mainnet",
  privateKeyProvider: provider,
});

const passkeysPlugin = new PasskeysPlugin({
  rpID: "your.app.xyz",
  rpName: "Your App",
});

web3auth.addPlugin(passkeysPlugin);

await web3auth.init();
```

### Register a Passkey

Use the following function to register a new passkey for a user:

```javascript
async function registerPasskey(username) {
  try {
    await passkeysPlugin.registerPasskey({
      username: username,
    });
    console.log("Passkey registered successfully");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error registering passkey:", error);
  }
}
```

### Login with a Passkey

Use the following function to log in a user with an existing passkey:

```javascript
async function loginWithPasskey(authenticatorId) {
  try {
    const user = await passkeysPlugin.loginWithPasskey({
      authenticatorId: authenticatorId,
    });
    console.log("User logged in successfully:", user);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error logging in with passkey:", error);
  }
}
```

### List All Passkeys

Use the following function to list all registered passkeys for a user:

```javascript
async function listAllPasskeys() {
  try {
    const passkeys = await passkeysPlugin.listAllPasskeys();
    console.log("Registered passkeys:", passkeys);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error listing passkeys:", error);
  }
}
```

## UI and UX Considerations

When integrating passkeys into your application, it's important to design a user-friendly flow for
both registration and login processes. Here are some best practices:

- **Clear Instructions:** Provide clear and concise instructions for users during the registration
  and login processes. Explain the benefits of using passkeys and how they enhance security.

- **Seamless Registration Flow:** Integrate the passkey registration process smoothly into your
  existing signup flow. Ensure users understand that they are creating a secure, passwordless method
  of authentication.

  ```javascript
  // Example registration flow
  async function handleRegistration() {
    // User signs up with traditional methods
    await traditionalSignup();

    // Register a passkey for the new user
    await registerPasskey(user.email);
  }
  ```

- **Intuitive Login Flow:** Make the login process with passkeys intuitive. Provide a clear option
  for users to log in using their passkey.

  ```javascript
  // Example login flow
  async function handleLogin() {
    // User initiates login
    const authenticatorId = await getAuthenticatorId();

    // Log in with the passkey
    await loginWithPasskey(authenticatorId);
  }
  ```

- **Fallback Options:** Always provide alternative login options such as email OTP, SMS OTP, or
  social logins. This ensures that users who cannot use passkeys still have a way to access their
  accounts.

  ```javascript
  // Example fallback options
  async function handleLogin() {
    try {
      const authenticatorId = await getAuthenticatorId();
      await loginWithPasskey(authenticatorId);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Passkey login failed, falling back to alternative methods:", error);
      // Provide alternative login methods here
    }
  }
  ```

- **User Feedback:** Provide real

-time feedback to users during the registration and login processes. Confirm successful passkey
creation or login and handle errors gracefully.
