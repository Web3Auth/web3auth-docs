In this guide, we'll talk about how we can use Web3Auth Single Factor Auth with Firebase in your
Android application.

As an overview, the guide is quite simple, with functionality to log in, display user details, and
perform blockchain interactions. The signing of the blockchain transactions is done through the
Web3Auth embedded wallet. You can check out the infrastructure docs,
["Web3Auth Wallet Management Infrastructure"](/docs/infrastructure) for a high-level overview of the
Web3Auth architecture and implementation. For those who want to skip straight to the code, you can
find it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-core-kit-examples/tree/main/single-factor-auth-android/sfa-android-quick-start).

## How to set up Web3Auth Dashboard

If you haven't already, sign up on the Web3Auth platform. It is free and gives you access to the
Web3Auth's base plan. After the basic setup, explore other features and functionalities offered by
the Web3Auth Dashboard. It includes custom verifiers, whitelabeling, analytics, and more. Head to
[Web3Auth's documentation](/docs/dashboard-setup) page for detailed instructions on setting up the
Web3Auth Dashboard.

## How to set up Firebase for Android

If you haven't already setup the Firebase for your Android app, please setup the Firebase, as it's
the prerequisites for the guide. Head to the
[Firebase's documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) for the details
instructions.

## How to set up Custom verifier

Once, you have set up the Web3Auth Dashboard, created a new project, and set up Firebase, it's time
to create a Custom Verifier for your Firebase application. We already have detail instructions on
how to create a Custom Verifier for Firebase, please head to our
[documentation](https://web3auth.io/docs/auth-provider-setup/authentication-service-providers/firebase-service-provider).

## Integrating Web3Auth SFA in Android

Once, you have set up the Custom Verifier, it's time to integrate Web3Auth in your Android
application. For the implementation, we'll use the "single-factor-auth-android". This SDK
facilitates integration with Web3Auth. This way you can easily manage embedded wallet in your
Android application.

### Installation

<Install />

For the prerequisites, and other mandatory configuration of the SDK, please head to our
[installation documentation](/docs/sdk/sfa/sfa-android/install).

### Initialization

After successfully installing the package, the next step is to instantiate `SingleFactorAuth` in
your Android app. This sets up the necessary configurations using Web3Auth network and prepares the
SDK. [Learn more about SingleFactorAuth Initialization](/docs/sdk/sfa/sfa-android/initialize).

<Instantiation />

Once you have successfully instantiated `SingleFactorAuth`, you can use the `initialize` method to
initialize the SDK with existing valid session.

<Initialization />

### Authentication

If the user is not authenticated, you should utilize the `connect` method. For the guide, we will
add Email Password login using Firebase. The `connect` method is pretty straightforward in
SingleFactorAuth and takes `LoginParams` as input. After successfully logging in, the method will
return the `SessionData`.

Learn more about [SingleFactorAuth LoginParams](/docs/sdk/sfa/sfa-android/usage#parameters). To more
about Firebase login methods, please
[checkout the Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/start).

```kotlin
private var auth: FirebaseAuthauth = Firebase.auth

// Take the input for email and password from user
auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword("android@firebase.com", "Android@Web3Auth")
    .addOnCompleteListener(this) {
        task ->
        if (task.isSuccessful) {
            // Sign in success, update UI with the signed-in user's information
            Log.d(TAG, "signInWithEmail:success")
            val user = auth.currentUser

            // Try to get a fresh idToken
            user!!.getIdToken(true).addOnSuccessListener {
                result ->
                val idToken = result.token

                Log.d(TAG, "GetTokenResult result = $idToken")

                if (idToken != null) {
                   val sub = user!!.id

                    // focus-start
                   val loginParams = LoginParams(
                        // Replace with your custom verifier name
                        "web3auth-firebase-examples",
                        sub,
                        idToken
                    )

                    try {
                        // Save the SessionData for future use to interact with Blockchain.
                       sessionData = singleFactorAuth.connect(
                            loginParams,
                            this.applicationContext,
                            86400
                        ).get()
                        // focus-end

                    } catch (e: ExecutionException) {
                        e.printStackTrace()
                    } catch (e: InterruptedException) {
                        e.printStackTrace()
                    }

                    publicAddress =sessionData?.publicAddress.toString()

                    println("""Private Key: ${sfaKey?.privateKey?.toString(16)}""".trimIndent())
                    println("""Public Address: $publicAddress""".trimIndent())

                    // Additional code
                };
            }
        } else {
            // Upon failur, display a message to the user.
            Log.w(TAG, "signInWithEmail:failure", task.exception)
            Toast.makeText(
                baseContext, "Authentication failed.",
                Toast.LENGTH_SHORT
            ).show()
        }
    }
```

## Set up Blockchain Providers

Once we have successfully authenticated the user, the next step would be to fetch the user details,
retrieve wallet address and prepare blockchain providers for interactions. For this guide, we are
supporting only Ethereum ecosystem, but the general idea can be used for any blockchain ecosystem.

For interacting with ethereum chains, we'll use the [web3j](https://github.com/hyperledger/web3j)
SDK. For installation, in your app-level build.gradle's dependencies section, add the web3j
dependency.

```groovy
dependencies {
  // ...
  implementation 'org.web3j:core:4.8.7-android'
}
```

After successfully installing SDK, it's time to create `Credentials` instance to retrive user's EOA
address, and interact with blockchain. To retrive the user's private key, we'll use the `SFAkey`
instance.

```kotlin
// focus-next-line
val credentials: Credentials = Credentials.create(sfaKey!.privateKey!.toString(16))

// User's EOA address
Log.d(TAG, credentials.address)
```

To retrive user's balance, and interacting with Blockcahin, you can follow our detailed guide on how
to [interact with EVM chain guides](/docs/connect-blockchain/evm/ethereum/android#get-balance).
Since, you already have created `Credentials` instance, and retrived the user's EOA address, you can
skip that part. To interact with Solana blockchain, you can checkout our
[Solana blockchain guide](/docs/connect-blockchain/solana/android).
