This guide will help you make a react application using Web3Auth Self Host, covering the basic functionality on how to use it. For a detailed
reference, you can refer to the [Web3Auth Self Host SDK Reference](http://localhost:3000/docs/sdk/self-host/installation).

**Live Demo:** https://selfhost.web3auth.io

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tkey/tkey-example.git
npm install
npm start
```

## Prerequisites

---

- A basic knowledge of JavaScript and React.
- Ideal to have a knowledge about service workers in React.
- A [Google Developer](https://console.developers.google.com/) account to be used as Login provider for Web3Auth Custom Authentication.
- Create a Web3Auth account on the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/)

## Understanding the tKey SDK

---

<TkeyIntroduction />

For this guide here, we will be talking through the [tKey SDK](/sdk/self-host/installation) and using the Custom Authentication through Google Login
alongside it.

## Setup

---

### Setup your Google App

1. Follow Googleâ€™s instructions to [set up an OAuth 2.0 app.](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en)
2. Add your application's redirect URI into the "Authorized redirect URIs" field. This is the URL that Google will redirect to after authentication.

   ![Google OAuth2.0 App Dashboard](/contents/social-providers/google/google-app-redirect-uri.png)

3. Obtain the OAuth `Client ID` from your [App on the Google Developer dashboard](https://console.developers.google.com/)

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

- Create a **Verifier** from the **Custom Auth** Section of the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) with following
  configuration:

  - Choose a name of your choice for the verifier identifier. `eg. google-core-verifier-ssv`
  - Select environment: `testnet`, `mainnet` or `cyan` as per your requirement.
  - Select `Google` from the **Login Provider**. ![Google - Login Providers list on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/login-providers-list.png)
  - Paste the **Client ID** from the Google App(above) to the `Client ID` field.
    ![Google Client ID on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/google-verifier.png)
  - Click on `Create` button to create your verifier. It may take up to 10 minutes to deploy verifier on _testnet_. You'll receive an email once it's
    complete.

- You will require the `verifierName` of the newly created verifier.

### Setting up your React Project

As mentioned in the prerequisites, we will need to use service workers while implementing the tKey SDK. This is because tKey forms an offchain
multisig which needs to sit within your browser context to be able to verify the ownership of the private key in a self custodial manner to the user
within their devices directly.

Hence, we need to create a progressive react application. This can be done by using the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app tkey-demo --template cra-template-pwa-typescript
cd tkey-demo
```

### Setting up the service worker

Further, we need to setup the service worker according to our needs of the project. Service worker basically sits between the frontend application,
browser and the network. It kind of acts as a proxy server enabling the off chain multisig which is the foundation of tKey. Configuring a service
worker is a totally different topic to cover, hence for the simplicity of this guide, we have added a boilerplate code that will work according to
your needs. Easiest way to do that is as follows

```bash
mkdir public/serviceworker
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkey/tkey-example/main/public/serviceworker/sw.js -O public/serviceworker/sw.js
```

<SetupBaseProject />

## Installation

---

For setting up the tKey SDK for this project, we will be following the
[standard installation](https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/self-host/installation#standard-installation), which contains all the needed functionalities of
the tkey SDK.

```bash
npm install --save @tkey/default
```

### Understanding the Dependencies

##### `@tkey/core`

This is the main **Core** package that contains the main tKey SDK.

```shell
npm install --save @tkey/core
```

##### `@tkey/service-provider-torus`

In the Web3Auth Self Host setup, you have to use the Web3Auth Service Provider (`@tkey/service-provider-torus`), which is basically implements
Web3Auth's Social Login feature as a service provider, enabling you to associate the social login of the user as one of the shares.

```shell
npm install --save @tkey/service-provider-torus
```

##### `@tkey/storage-layer-torus`

The storage layer is needed to store and recall metadata information of the shares generated so as to be able to recover the private key from the
tKeys generated. For this we use the `@tkey/storage-layer-torus` SDK, giving you the ability to get and set the Metadata for the various shares
generated.

#### Adding Modules

```shell
npm install --save @tkey/storage-layer-torus
```

<SelfHostModule />

## Initialization

---

After Installation, the next step to use Web3Auth Self Host is to Initialize the SDK.

The Initialization takes a few steps, which basically involve initiating the SDK and setting up the service provider, storage layer and modules.

1. [Configuration of Service Provider](/sdk/self-host/initialization#configuring-service-provider) _(recommended for social login shares)_
2. [Configuration of Storage Layer](/sdk/self-host/initialization#configuring-storage-layer) _(optional)_
3. [Configuration of Modules](/sdk/self-host/initialization#configuring-modules) _(optional)_
4. **[Instantiation of tKey](/sdk/self-host/initialization#instantiating-tkey)**
5. [Initialization of Service Provider](/sdk/self-host/initialization#initializing-service-provider) _(recommended for social login shares)_
6. [Triggering Login using Service Provider](/sdk/self-host/initialization#triggering-login-using-service-provider) _(recommended for social login
   shares)_
7. **[Initialization of tKey](/sdk/self-host/initialization#initializing-tkey)**

Please note that these are the most critical steps where you need to pass on different parameters according to your project. You can go to the
particular links to learn about each step properly. For the sake of this guide, we will be using the following code for initialization:

```js
import { useEffect } from "react";
import ThresholdKey from "@tkey/default";
import WebStorageModule, { WEB_STORAGE_MODULE_NAME } from "@tkey/web-storage";
import TorusServiceProvider from "@tkey/service-provider-torus";
import TorusStorageLayer from "@tkey/storage-layer-torus";
import SecurityQuestionsModule from "@tkey/security-questions";
import ShareTransferModule from "@tkey/share-transfer";

// 1. Configuration of Service Provider
const directParams = {
  baseUrl: `${window.location.origin}/serviceworker`,
  enableLogging: true,
  network: "testnet" as any,
};
const serviceProvider = new TorusServiceProvider({ directParams });
// 2. Configuration of Storage Layer
const storageLayer = new TorusStorageLayer({ hostUrl: "https://metadata.tor.us" });
// 3. Configuration of Modules
const webStorageModule = new WebStorageModule();
const securityQuestionsModule = new SecurityQuestionsModule();
const shareTransferModule = new ShareTransferModule();
// 4. Instantiation of tKey
const tKey = new ThresholdKey({
  serviceProvider: serviceProvider,
  storageLayer,
  modules: { webStorage: webStorageModule, securityQuestions: securityQuestionsModule, shareTransfer: shareTransferModule },
});

function App() {
  // Init Service Provider inside the useEffect Method
  useEffect(() => {
    const init = async () => {
      // 5. Initialization of Service Provider
      await (tKey.serviceProvider as TorusServiceProvider).init({ skipSw: false });
      try {
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
      }
    };

    init();
  }, []);
}
```

### Triggering Login using Service Provider

Once you have initialised the Web3Auth Service Provider, you're ready to trigger the login process. This is a needed step since this will generate a
private key which will be needed by the tKey to generate it's share. This is done by calling the `triggerLogin()` function within the `tKey`
instance's `serviceProvider` property.

:::tip

Checkout the [Service Provider Reference](/sdk/self-host/service-provider#triggering-login) to know more about `triggerLogin()` and its configuration.

:::

```js
const triggerLogin = async () => {
  try {
    // 6. Triggering Login using Service Provider ==> opens the popup
    const loginResponse = await (tKey.serviceProvider as TorusServiceProvider).triggerLogin({
      typeOfLogin: "google",
      verifier: "your-verifier",
      clientId: "your-client-id",
    });
    console.log(loginResponse);
    console.log("Public Key : " + loginResponse.publicAddress);
    console.log("Email : " + loginResponse.userInfo.email);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};
```

### Initialise tKey

Once you have triggered the login process, you're ready to initialize the tKey. This will generate you a Threshold Key corresponding to your login
provider.

```js
const initializeNewKey = async () => {
  try {
    await triggerLogin(); // Calls the triggerLogin() function above (step 6)
    // 7. Initialization of tKey
    await tKey.initialize();
    const res = await tKey._initializeNewKey({ initializeModules: true });
    console.log("response from _initializeNewKey", res);
    console.log("Private Key " + res.privKey);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error, "caught");
  }
};
```

## Usage

### Reconstruct Key

Reconstruct the Private Key from the shares

```js
const reconstructKey = async () => {
  try {
    console.log("Reconstucting key");
    let reconstructedKey = await tKey.reconstructKey();
    console.log(reconstructedKey.privKey);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error, "caught");
  }
};
```

### Get Tkey Details

```js
const getTKeyDetails = async () => {
  console.log("Tkey details");
  console.log(tKey.getKeyDetails());
};
```

### Generating a new share with a password

Generate a new share using the security questions module

```js
const generateNewShareWithPassword = async () => {
    console.log("Generating new share with password");
    // swal is just a pretty dialog box
    swal("Enter password (>10 characters)", {
      content: "input" as any,
    }).then(async (value) => {
      if (value.length > 10) {
        await (tKey.modules.securityQuestions as SecurityQuestionsModule).generateNewShareWithSecurityQuestions(value, "whats your password?");
        console.log("Successfully generated new share with password.");
      } else {
        swal("Error", "Password must be > 10 characters", "error");
      }
    });
    await getTKeyDetails();
  };
```

### Import Share from Security Question

Import a new share using the security questions module

```js
const inputShareFromSecurityQuestions = async () => {
    console.log("Importing Share from Security Question");
    swal("What is your password ?", {
      content: "input" as any,
    }).then(async (value) => {
      if (value.length > 10) {
        await (tKey.modules.securityQuestions as SecurityQuestionsModule).inputShareFromSecurityQuestions(value);
        console.log("Imported Share using the security question");
      } else {
        swal("Error", "Password must be > 10 characters", "error");
      }
    });
  };
```

### Request Share

```js
const requestShare = async () => {
    console.log("Requesting New Share");
    try {
      const result = await (tKey.modules.shareTransfer as ShareTransferModule).requestNewShare(navigator.userAgent, tKey.getCurrentShareIndexes());
      console.log(result);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);

      const requests = await (tKey.modules.shareTransfer as ShareTransferModule).lookForRequests();
      let shareToShare;
      try {
        shareToShare = await (tKey.modules.webStorage as WebStorageModule).getDeviceShare();
      } catch (err) {
        console.error("No on device share found. Generating a new share");
        const newShare = await tKey.generateNewShare();
        shareToShare = newShare.newShareStores[newShare.newShareIndex.toString("hex")];
      }
      console.log(result, requests, tKey);

      await (tKey.modules.shareTransfer as ShareTransferModule).approveRequest(requests[0], shareToShare);
      // await this.tbsdk.modules.shareTransfer.deleteShareTransferStore(requests[0]) // delete old share requests
      console.log("Approved Share Transfer request");
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
    }
  };
```

### Check Share Request

```js
const checkShareRequests = async () => {
    consoleText("Checking Share Reuqests");
    try {
      const result = await (tKey.modules.shareTransfer as ShareTransferModule).getShareTransferStore();
      const requests = await (tKey.modules.shareTransfer as ShareTransferModule).lookForRequests();
      console.log("Share Requests" + JSON.stringify(requests));
      console.log("Share requests", requests);
      console.log("Share Transfer Store", result);
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  };
```

### Reset Share Request

Reset the share requests store

```js
const resetShareRequests = async () => {
    console.log("Resetting Share Transfer Requests");
    try {
      const res = await (tKey.modules.shareTransfer as ShareTransferModule).resetShareTransferStore();
      console.log(res);
      console.log("Reset share transfer successful");
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  };
```

### Interacting with Blockchain

So if you have completed this far, it means that you have successfully authenticated your user. Once you have logged in your user and resconstructed
the key, you can directly use the private key to make the RPC calls. You can also use our You can use the
[Provider SDKs](https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/providers/) to perform RPC Calls to your blockchain.

Web3Auth is chain agnostic, ie. depending on whatever blockchain or layer-2 you use, Web3Auth can easily support that. Web3Auth has native providers
for EVM and Solana blockchains and for others, you can get the private key in the user scope and make RPC calls. For standardising the type of
provider, Web3Auth Base provides a SafeEventEmitterProvider from which you can create your own provider.
