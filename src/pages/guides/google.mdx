This guide will cover the basics of how to set up your Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK and
Google Login for custom authentication and provide you the steps on how to develop a basic web
application on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Live Demo:** https://web3auth-core-google-demo.vercel.app

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/web-no-modal-sdk/custom-authentication/single-verifier-examples/google-no-modal-example w3a-google-demo && cd w3a-google-demo && npm install && npm run start
```

## How it works?

When integrating Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK with Google Login the flow looks something like
this:

![Web3Auth Core - Google Login Flow](/images/implicit-flow.svg)

- When a user logs in with `Google`, Google sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is
  sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for
  the user, in a self-custodial way, resulting in easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Prerequisites

<Web3AuthPrerequisites />

- A [Google Developer](https://console.developers.google.com) account to be used as Login provider
  for Web3Auth Custom Authentication.

## Setup

### Setup your Google App

<GoogleAppSetup />

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth
to your project. To know more about the available SDKs, please have a look at this
[documentation page](/sdk).

For this guide, we will be talking through the
[Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal) and using the
[Auth Adapter](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/auth) alongside it to enable Custom Authentication through
Google Login.

### Installation

<Installation />

### Initialization

<InitializationIntro />

For this guide, we're only focusing on the Instantiation, Configuration for the Auth Adapter (the
default adapter that enables social logins) and Initialization of the Web3Auth SDK. To know more
about the other things you can do with Web3Auth, check out our
[SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal).

#### Instantiating Web3Auth

<InstantiationWeb3Auth />

#### Initializing the Auth Adapter

<AuthConfigCodeGoogle />

Here, you need to pass over your Web3Auth `clientId` in the adapterSettings object and your Custom
Auth `verifierName` and AWS Cognito `clientId` in the loginConfig object. This makes sure that the
Auth Adapter can connect to the correct verifier and AWS Cognito server.

<InitializationWeb3Auth />

### Authentication

#### Logging in

Once initialized, you can use the `connectTo()` function to authenticate the user when they click
the login button.

```tsx
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.AUTH, {
  loginProvider: "google",
});
```

When connecting, your `connectTo` function takes the arguments for the adapter you want to connect
to and the `loginProvider` for the login.

### Get the User Profile

```tsx
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

Using the `getUserInfo` function, you can get the details of the logged-in user. Please note that
these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth network, but are fetched from the id_token you
received from AWS Cognito and live in the frontend context.

### Logout

```tsx
await web3auth.logout();
```

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.

## Example code

The code for the application we developed in this guide can be found in the
[Web3Auth Core Google Login Example](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/tree/main/web-no-modal-sdk/custom-authentication/single-verifier-examples/google-no-modal-example).
Check it out and try running it locally yourself!
