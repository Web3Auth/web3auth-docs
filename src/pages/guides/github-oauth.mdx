This guide will cover the basics of how to integrate Web3Auth with GitHub OAuth for authentication.
Web3Auth is employed to provide Ethereum private key access and public address and GitHub OAuth is
used to authenticate users

Full example:
https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-core-kit-examples/tree/main/single-factor-auth-node/github-oauth-connection

We use two web3auth libraries in this project: `@web3auth/ethereum-provider` and
`@web3auth/node-sdk`.

To install them, run: `npm install @web3auth/ethereum-provider @web3auth/node-sdk`

## How it works?

As explain in the
[github OAuth Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#web-application-flow),
The web integration would be like this steps:

![Github Flow](/images/oauth/github-oauth-flow.jpg)

1. Request a user's GitHub identity

   - `GET https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize`

2. Users are redirected back to your site by GitHub

   - Exchange this code for an access token:
   - `POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`
   - ```
       Accept: application/json
       {
       "access_token":"gho_16C7e42....e178B4a",
       "scope":"repo,gist",
       "token_type":"bearer"
       }
     ```

3. The Token is sent to Web3auth (Instead of access the Github API.)
   - Github sends a `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login
     function. Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for the user, in a self custodial way,
     resulting in easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Create a JWKS file

A JWKS stands for JSON Web Key Set. It is a set of keys containing the public keys that should be
used to verify any JSON Web Token (JWT) issued by the authorization server and signed using the
RS256 signing algorithm.

If you don't know how to create a JWKS, you can follow this
[web3auth tutorial](/docs/auth-provider-setup/byo-jwt-provider/#how-to-create-jwks). This file must
be located on a public endpoint. To test the example, you will need to modify the file located in
the root directory of the project.

Both the private and the public keys, that you used to create the JWKS, must be in the server
directory. In our project, they are called `private.pem` and `public.pem`.

## Set up Custom JWT Verifier

![Custom JWT Provider on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/dashboard/create-verifier-custom-jwt.png)

To create a custom verifier for your JWT Provider, you'll need the follow this steps:

1. The verifier Identifier, which would be the name. This name should be used in your .ENV file as
   `WEB3AUTH_VERIFIER`.

2. **JWT Verifier ID**: JWT Verifier ID is the unique identifier to publicly represent a user on a
   verifier. e.g: `sub`, `email`, or even a custom field of your JWT payload that is unique in your
   system for each user. In this case, we are using the `sub` field.

3. **JWK Endpoint**: An endpoint containing the JWKS used to sign the JWT. In my example I'm using a
   static github url file.

4. In the Select JWT Validation. You will add `iss` and `aud` fields (eplace both with your real
   Github Client ID.).
   - The `iss` field is the issuer of the JWT. In this case "https://github.com"
   - The `aud` field is the audience of the JWT. In this case
     "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token"

## How to create a App in Github

- In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo.
- Navigate to your account settings.
- For an app owned by a personal account, click Settings.
- For an app owned by an organization: (Click Your organizations.)
- To the right of the organization, click Settings.
- In the left sidebar, click Developer settings.
- In the left sidebar, click GitHub Apps or OAuth apps.

![CCreate a github App](/images/oauth/github-create-app.jpg)

You have to configure you Homepage URL: `http://localhost:5005` and the callback URL
`http://localhost:5005/github/callback`

After creating the app, you'll need the Client Application ID into the .ENV file. Then click on
"Generate a new client secret" and copy to use it also in the .ENV file.

## Running the example

Execute `npm run dev`. To initiate the Github OAuth flow, Open your browser to
`http://localhost:5005/github/login`

Finally, after loginning in as a result, you will receive in the callback url a JSON with the user
data, the JWT token, the Ethereum address and private key.

```json
{
   "userData":{
      "login":"<alias>",
      "id":<id>,
      "node_id":"MSSSSS",
      "gravatar_id":"",
      "url":"https://api.github.com/users/<name>",
      "type":"User",
      "site_admin":false,
      "name":"Name",
      "company":"Web3Auth",
      "location":"AR, CABA",
      "email":null,
      "hireable":null,
      "bio":"<description>",
      "twitter_username":null,
      "public_repos":43,
      "public_gists":0,
      "followers":10,
      "following":12,
      "created_at":"2011-07-28T17:24:29Z",
      "updated_at":"2024-02-29T15:54:30Z"
   },
   "jwtToken":"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cC....oWw",
   "ethData":{
      "ethPrivateKey":"f8fe70c14868b709b0....1498a9db5",
      "ethPublicAddress":[
         "0x3d9c0cfff5c0a25....5a53fd6f4b678990f9"
      ]
   }
}
```

## Code guide

In the example, we are using express for the server. This are the Endpoint that we are using:

- The initial endpoint to start the Github OAuth flow.

```javascript
app.get("/github/login", (req, res) => {
  res.redirect(
    `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=${githubClientId}&redirect_uri=${githubRedirectUri}`,
  );
});
```

- The Callback endpoint to receive the JWT token and exchange it for an access token.

```javascript
app.get("/github/callback", async (req, res) => {
  const code = req.query.code;
  try {
    const accessToken = await exchangeCodeForAccessToken(code);
    const userData = await fetchGitHubUserDetails(accessToken);
    const jwtToken = generateJwtToken(userData);
    const ethData = await getPrivateKey(jwtToken, userData.id.toString());
    res.json({ userData, jwtToken, ethData });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send("Error during GitHub authentication");
  }
});
```

In the `getPrivateKey` function, we use Web3auth to establish a connection with the provider and get
both the address and the private key.

```javascript
const getPrivateKey = async (idToken: string, verifierId: string) => {
    const web3authNodeprovider = await web3auth.connect({
        verifier: process.env.WEB3AUTH_VERIFIER,
        verifierId,
        idToken,
    });
    // The private key returned here is the CoreKit Key
    const ethPrivateKey = await web3authNodeprovider.request({ method: "eth_private_key" });
    const ethPublicAddress = await web3authNodeprovider.request({ method: "eth_accounts" });
    const ethData = {
        ethPrivateKey,
        ethPublicAddress,
    };
    return ethData;
};
```
