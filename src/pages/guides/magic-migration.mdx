In this guide, we'll compare Magic and Web3Auth and explain how to migrate your existing users from
Magic to Web3Auth.

We'll start by comparing both services based on several key parameters: wallet management
architecture, authentication options, and multi-chain and multi-platform support. If you're ready to
jump straight to the migration process,
[you can find the instructions here](#how-to-migrate-to-web3auth).

## Why choose Web3Auth?

Both Web3Auth and Magic have made significant strides in addressing the Web3 onboarding challenge.
However, Web3Auth stands out by offering more customizable authentication options, along with
superior support for multi-chain and multi-platform integrations.

| Parameter              | Magic                                                                                             | Web3Auth                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wallet Management      | Magic uses the HSM wallet to manage user's private key which doesn't make it fully non-custodial. | Web3Auth uses SSS and MPC TSS to manage user's private key, which is fully non custodial implementation.                                                                                       |
| Multi-chain support    | Magic as of now only supports 25+ blockchains as per their docs.                                  | Web3Auth is chain agnostic, it supports both secp256k1 and ed25519 curves which means it can be integrated with any chain that uses these curves.                                              |
| Multi-platform support | Magic supports multi-platform including Web, Android, Flutter, iOS, Unity, and React native.      | Web3Auth supports multiple platforms, including Web, React Native, Unity, Unreal, Flutter, Swift, and Android. [Checkout documentation for more details](/docs/sdk?product=Plug%20and%20Play). |
| Additional Features    | Magic provides additional features as NFT services for free minting and checkout.                 | Web3Auth also offers additional services such as NFT checkout, Fiat On Ramp, and Prebuilt Wallet UI. All of these services could be added in your project with few lines code.                 |
| Ease of Integration    | Magic is easy to integrate where basic integration takes less than 15 minutes                     | Web3Auth is also easy to integrate where basic integration takes less than 15 minutes.                                                                                                         |
| Whitelabel             | Magic has limited white-labelling options.                                                        | Web3Auth also has end to end white-labelling options.                                                                                                                                          |

## How to migrate to Web3Auth

Now that we've discussed the advantages of Web3Auth, let's explore the steps to migrate from Magic
to Web3Auth. We'll cover most scenarios, but if we miss any, please don't hesitate to reach out to
us in comments.

### Embedded Wallet/ Dedicated Wallet

If you are using Magic's embedded wallet/ dedicated wallet, there are couple of options which can be
preferred for the migration.

#### Using Plug And Play SDK

If you want to use the Plug and Play SDK, you can first check whether the user is an existing user
or if they have any wallet balance. For new users or those with empty wallets, you can simply
generate a new wallet for them to replace the old one.

For existing users with non-empty wallets, you have two options:

##### Migration tool

You can create a migration tool to transfer funds to the newly generated Web3Auth embedded wallet.
To facilitate the fund transfer using the migration tool, you can utilize our
[Wallet Pregeneration feature](/docs/features/wallet-pregeneration) to determine the user's wallet
address without integrating our SDKs. By leveraging wallet pregeneration, you can handle the
migration in the backend seamlessly. Afterward, you can use the PnP/ SFA SDK to log users in through
Web3Auth.

Let's see how you can use the Wallet Pregeneration API.

```tsx
const apiUrl = "https://lookup.web3auth.io/lookup";

const params = new URLSearchParams({
  verifier: "YOUR_VERIFIER_NAME",
  verifierId: "YOUR_VERIFIER_ID",
  web3AuthNetwork: "sapphire_mainnet",
  clientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID",
});

const url = `${apiUrl}?${params.toString()}`;

// Response
// {
//   "data": {
//     "evmAddress": "0x172b0Ca9405BcE41A0D6FB3B44f91098d3a4AB14",
//     "X": "a3350640a380f772434a18952fa53c6a8c200e9e3d30e1097edbd92be6dd9fe0",
//     "Y": "1ded08adccba8e394f9a9d7ee55658aab8f2aef17866983c0bdcd68d31b59341",
//     "isMfaEnabled": false
//   },
//   "success": true
// }
```

Please ensure that the useCoreKitKey parameter is set to true when using the Wallet Pregeneration
API and the PnP SDK. This will ensure that the same address is generated when user logs in for the
first time.

```tsx
const chainConfig = YOUR_CUSTOM_CHAIN_CONFIG;

const ethereumPrivateKeyProvider = EthereumPrivateKeyProvider({
  config: { chainConfig },
});

const web3auth = new Web3Auth({
  clientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID",
  web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
  privateKeyProvider: ethereumPrivateKeyProvider,
  // highlight-next-line
  useCoreKitKey: true,
});
```

##### Manual Migration

The other option would be to show a prompt to users, asking them to migrate their funds from the old
wallet to the new Web3Auth embedded wallet. It's totally upto users how they want to migrate.

You can also suggest your users to use tools like [Token Bulksender](https://bulksender.app/).
Again, DYOR.

#### Using MPC Core Kit SDK

Using the MPC Core Kit is the recommended approach for migrating users. If you have existing users
with a Magic's embedded wallet, you can seamlessly transition them to Web3Auth while retaining the
same account.

The first step is to export the Magic's embedded wallet private key. To do this, you can use the
`revealPrivateKey` method. This will open the modal for users to copy their private key.
[For more details on exporting accounts, learn more here](https://magic.link/docs/wallets/features/key-export).

Please note that there is no internal method to export the private key in Magic. Only the user can
access their full private key. When you use the `revealPrivateKey` method, it will display the reval
private key modal for the user to copy their private key. Once the key is copied, you can prompt
them to import it using an input field.

```tsx
import { Magic } from "magic-sdk";

const magic = new Magic("PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY");

try {
  await magic.user.revealPrivateKey();
} catch {
  // Handle errors if required!
}
```

You can now show the prompt to enter the private key they copied. Once you have the private key, you
can simply import it into `Web3AuthMpCoreKit`. When you import the private key, it is split into
multiple partial keys, which are never stored together in one place. Furthermore, in the MPC
architecture, the private key is never reconstructed, enhancing security. The partial keys are
stored in different locations and the user's device. These partial keys are used to create partial
signatures for messages and transactions. These partial signatures are then combined using Threshold
Signature Scheme (TSS) to produce a final signature, which can be used for transactions on the
blockchain. MPC Core Kit supports both secp256k1 and ed25519 curves, so you can generate both ECDSA
and EdDSA signatures.

[Learn more about MPC Core Kit](/docs/sdk/core-kit/mpc-core-kit).

```tsx
// Your own logic to retrive google login id Token
const idTokenLoginParams = {
  verifier: "w3a-google-demo",
  verifierId: parsedIdToken.email,
  idToken: parsedIdToken,
  // Use the exported private key from previous step
  // highlight-next-line
  importTssKey: magicPrivateKey,
} as IdTokenLoginParams;

const coreKitInstance = new Web3AuthMPCCoreKit({
  web3AuthClientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID",
  web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.DEVNET,
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
});

await coreKitInstance.init();
await coreKitInstance.loginWithJWT(idTokenLoginParams);
```

### AA Wallet

Web3Auth is compatible with all major Account Abstraction (AA) SDKs, including Alchemy, Biconomy,
Pimlico, ZeroDev, and Safe. To learn more,
[please check out our AA Demo](https://w3a-aa-gasless-demo.vercel.app/).

If you are using a Magic's embedded wallet/ dedicated wallet as a signer for an ERC 4337 (Account
Abstraction) wallet, you can easily add the Web3Auth embedded wallet as an additional signer. This
will enable existing users to seamlessly migrate to the Web3Auth embedded wallet. Alternatively, you
can prompt users to remove the Magic signer if preferred.

const { hash } = await magicEcdsaProvider.changeOwner("WEB3AUTH_EMBEDDED_WALLET_ADDRESS");

// Considering you have setup the Web3Auth instance
const web3authProvider = web3auth.provider;

if (!web3authProvider) {
  throw new Error("No provider found");
}

// Create the smart account signer from the provider and signer address
const smartAccountSigner = await providerToSmartAccountSigner(web3authProvider as EIP1193Provider);

// Generate the ZeroDev wallet for new signer.
const web3AuthEcdsaProvider = await signerToEcdsaValidator(publicClient, {
  signer: smartAccountSigner,

    paymasterServiceData: { mode: PaymasterMode.SPONSORED },
  },
);

const receipt = await response.wait();

### External Wallets

If you are using external wallet(Third Party Wallets) using Magic's Embedded Plug & Play Widget, and
are looking to integrate with Web3Auth, the migration process is quite straightforward. Web3Auth
offers external multiple adapters to connect with external wallets, along with social login options
for added convenience. Along with external wallets, Web3Auth also supports application wallets like
Torus wallet.

If you are using EVM external wallets previously with Magic, you can simply configure the
`@web3auth/default-evm-adapter` for your Web3Auth instance.
[Read more about default-evm-adapter](/docs/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/default-evm-adapter).

```tsx
import { getDefaultExternalAdapters } from "@web3auth/default-evm-adapter";
import { EthereumPrivateKeyProvider } from "@web3auth/ethereum-provider";

// This can be your custom chain as well.
const chainConfig = {
  chainId: "0x1",
  rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth",
  displayName: "Ethereum Mainnet",
  blockExplorerUrl: "https://etherscan.io/",
  ticker: "ETH",
  tickerName: "Ethereum",
  logo: "https://images.toruswallet.io/eth.svg",
};

const privateKeyProvider = new EthereumPrivateKeyProvider({ config: { chainConfig } });

const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
  "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID",
  chainConfig: { ...chainConfig, chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155 },
  web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
  privateKeyProvider: privateKeyProvider,
};

const web3Auth = new Web3Auth(web3AuthOptions);

// highlight-start
const adapters = await getDefaultExternalAdapters({ options: web3AuthOptions });

adapters.forEach((adapter) => {
  web3auth.configureAdapter(adapter);
});
// highlight-end
```

If you are a fan boy of wagmi-connector, we have got your covered. You can use our
web3auth-wagmi-connector to initialize a wagmi client that will seamlessly manage the interaction of
your dApp with
Web3Auth.[Read more about web3auth-wagmi-connector](/docs/sdk/pnp/web/wagmi-connector).

```tsx
import { Web3AuthConnector } from "@web3auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector";
import { Web3Auth } from "@web3auth/modal";
import { EthereumPrivateKeyProvider } from "@web3auth/ethereum-provider";
import { CHAIN_NAMESPACES, WEB3AUTH_NETWORK, WALLET_ADAPTERS } from "@web3auth/base";
import { Chain } from "wagmi/chains";
import { WalletServicesPlugin } from "@web3auth/wallet-services-plugin";

export default function Web3AuthConnectorInstance(chains: Chain[]) {
  const chainConfig = {
    chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155,
    chainId: "0x" + chains[0].id.toString(16),
    rpcTarget: chains[0].rpcUrls.default.http[0],
    displayName: chains[0].name,
    tickerName: chains[0].nativeCurrency?.name,
    ticker: chains[0].nativeCurrency?.symbol,
    blockExplorerUrl: chains[0].blockExplorers?.default.url[0] as string,
  };

  const privateKeyProvider = new EthereumPrivateKeyProvider({ config: { chainConfig } });

  const web3AuthInstance = new Web3Auth({
    clientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID",
    chainConfig,
    privateKeyProvider,
    web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
    enableLogging: true,
  });

  const modalConfig = {
    [WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN]: {
      label: "openlogin",
      loginMethods: {
        facebook: {
          // It will hide the facebook option from the Web3Auth modal.
          name: "facebook login",
          showOnModal: false,
        },
      },
      // Setting it to false will hide all social login methods from modal.
      showOnModal: true,
    },
  };

  return Web3AuthConnector({
    web3AuthInstance,
    modalConfig,
  });
}
```
