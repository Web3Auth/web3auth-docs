This guide will cover the basics of how to set up your Web3Auth SDK and Auth0 account for the
integration and provide you with the links on how to develop a basic web application on the
blockchain of your choice.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit Web3Auth/web3auth-core-kit-examples/single-factor-auth-web/sfa-web-auth0-example sfa-web-auth0-demo && cd sfa-web-auth0-demo && npm install && npm run start
```

## How it works?

Single Factor Auth SDKs allow for the integration of a single factor of authentication, such as
social login, into your dApp. They are designed to be simple to use and can be integrated into your
dApp with minimal effort, allowing you to directly use the Web3Auth Network for Wallet Management.
This is one of the most common use cases of Web3Auth, however, it is semi-custodial in nature, since
the key is custodial to the Auth Provider and the Web3Auth Network.

- The first step for the application is to get the user authenticated by a login provider(here,
  Google) and get the user's `idToken`.
- Once the social login is successful, depending on whether the user has enabled **Multi-Factor
  Authentication(MFA)** or not, the key is generated.
- If the user has not enabled MFA, we use the `@web3auth/single-factor-auth` SDK to retrieve the
  private key shares from the Web3Auth auth network nodes and reconstruct the private key.
- If the user has enabled MFA, an error message is shown that the user has enabled MFA and in this
  case, they should be using the Web3Auth Plug and Play Web SDKs.

## Prerequisites

## Setup your Auth0 Tenant

## Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

### Create Auth0 Verifiers

<Auth0VerifierSetup />

## Using the Web3Auth SFA JS SDK

To use the Web3Auth SFA JS SDK, you need to add `@web3auth/single-factor-auth` to your project.

<SetupBaseProject />

### Installation

For this project, you need to add the following Web3Auth dependencies to your package.json

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/single-factor-auth @web3auth/ethereum-provider @web3auth/base web3 @auth0/auth0-react
```

#### Understanding the Dependencies

##### `@web3auth/base`

Since we're using typescript, we need the **`@web3auth/base`** package to provide the types of the
different variables we'll be using throughout the app-building process. This reduces errors to a
very large extent.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

##### `@web3auth/ethereum-provider`

This package is used to provide the Ethereum provider to the Web3Auth SDK. This is required to
interact with the blockchain.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/ethereum-provider
```

##### `@web3auth/single-factor-auth`

This package is the core package for Single Factor Auth JS SDK.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/single-factor-auth
```

##### `@auth0/auth0-react`

This package is used to provide the Auth0 SDK to the app. This is required to retrieve the `idToken`
from Auth0 as the login provider.

```shell
npm install --save @auth0/auth0-react
```

##### `web3`

This package is used to interact with the blockchain.

```shell
npm install --save web3
```

### Wrapping component with `Auth0Provider`

To use the Auth0 SDK, we need to wrap our app with the `Auth0Provider` component. This component
provides the Auth0 `domain`, `clientId` and `authorizationParams` to the app.

```tsx
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import { Auth0Provider } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement);
root.render(
  <Auth0Provider
    domain="web3auth.au.auth0.com" // Your Auth0 domain
    clientId="hUVVf4SEsZT7syOiL0gLU9hFEtm2gQ6O" // Your Auth0 client id
    authorizationParams={{
      redirect_uri: window.location.origin,
      connection: "github", // Your Auth0 social login provider
    }}
  >
    <App />
  </Auth0Provider>,
);
```

### Initialization

Once installed, your Web3Auth application needs to be initialized. Initialization is a multi-step
process where we add all the config details for Web3Auth SDK:

<SFAWebInstantiation />

#### Initializing the Web3Auth SDK

```tsx
web3authSfa.init(privateKeyProvider);
```

### Authentication

#### Getting the `idToken` from Auth0 upon login

```tsx
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

const { getIdTokenClaims, loginWithPopup } = useAuth0();

await loginWithPopup();
const idToken = (await getIdTokenClaims())?.__raw.toString();
```

<ParseIdtokenGetSub />

<SfaWebAuth0Intialization />

:::info

Since we are directly using Single Factor Auth SDK to log in, the Web3Auth `getUserInfo` function
won't work. We need to get the user details directly from the `idToken`.

:::

<UserInfoFromIdtoken />

### Logout

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function on the Web3Auth SDK.

```tsx
await web3authSfa.logout();
```
