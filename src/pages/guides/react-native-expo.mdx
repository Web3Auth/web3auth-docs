This guide will cover the basics of how to use the Web3Auth React Native SDK in your React Native
application.

**Live Demo:** [Coming Soon]

Repository: https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/tree/main/react-native/rn-expo-example

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/react-native/rn-expo-example w3a-rn-expo-demo && cd w3a-rn-expo-demo && npm install
```

```bash
# For Android
npm run android
# For iOS
npm run ios
```

## How it works?

When integrating Web3Auth React Native SDK with Social Login the flow looks something like this:

![Web3Auth Core - Social Login Flow](/images/implicit-flow.svg)

- When a user logs in with `Google`, Google sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is
  sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for
  the user, in a self custodial way, resulting in easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Prerequisites

<Web3AuthPrerequisites />

- Expo SDK 45 and above (for Expo Managed Workflow)

## Setup

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

- Add `{YOUR_APP_SCHEME}://auth` in the **Whitelist URL** field of the Web3Auth Dashboard.

### Configure Deep Link

<RNExpoDeepLink />

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth
to your project. To know more about the available SDKs, please have a look at this
[documentation page](/sdk).

For this guide, we will be talking through the [Web3Auth React Native SDK](/sdk/pnp/react-native).

### Installation

##### [`@web3auth/react-native-sdk`](https://github.com/web3auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/react-native-sdk
```

#### Expo Web Browser

When using our SDK with an Expo-based React Native app (aka managed workflow, you have to install
the `expo-web-browser` package as a `WebBrowser` implementation.)

```shell
expo install expo-web-browser
```

#### Expo Secure Store

We will require a `SecureStore` implementation to allow for session management without storing the
private key on the device.

```shell
expo install expo-secure-store
```

### Initialization

After Installation, the next step to use Web3Auth is to Initialize the SDK. The Initialization is a
two-step process,

- [Importing Required Packages](/sdk/pnp/react-native/initialize#importing-required-packages)
- [Instantiating Web3Auth](#instantiating-web3auth)

Please note that these are the most critical steps where you need to pass on different parameters
according to the preference of your project. Additionally, Whitelabeling and Custom Authentication
have to be configured within this step, if you wish to customize your Web3Auth Instance.

#### Importing `Web3Auth`

You may also import additional types from the SDK to help in the development process.

```typescript
import Web3Auth, { LOGIN_PROVIDER, OPENLOGIN_NETWORK } from "@web3auth/react-native-sdk";
```

#### Importing a `WebBrowser` implementation

```typescript
import * as WebBrowser from "expo-web-browser";
```

#### Importing `SecureStore` implementation

```typescript
import * as SecureStore from "expo-secure-store";
```

#### Instantiating Web3Auth

It's time to create an instance of Web3Auth in the project.

We need `clientId` and target Web3Auth `network` to initialize the `web3auth` object.

- You can get your `clientId` from registering (above) on the Developer Dashboard.

- `network` signifies the network on which the deployed Web3Auth nodes are running. For testing
  purposes, we have a `Sapphire Devnet` network. For production usage, you can use the
  `Sapphire Mainnet` network.

```tsx
const web3auth = new Web3Auth(WebBrowser, SecureStore, {
  clientId,
  network: OPENLOGIN_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET, // SAPPHIRE_MAINNET or SAPPHIRE_DEVNET
});
```

:::tip SDK Reference

- [Instantiating Web3Auth](/sdk/pnp/react-native/initialize).

### Authentication

#### Logging in

Once initialized, you can use the `login` function of `web3auth` to navigate the user to the login
process. For each login method, you have to select the `loginProvider` such as `google`, `facebook`,
`twitch`, `jwt`, `email_passwordless` etc.

:::info JWT

If you are using custom authentication through **Auth0 or Custom JWT**, you have to use the `JWT`
login provider.

Additionally, in `extraLoginOptions` you have to provide the details required by that specific
method as mentioned here.

:::

Once a user logs in, the Web3Auth SDK returns their reconstructed private key. For EVM Blockchains,
the `secp256k1` private key is used to sign transactions. We also return an `ed25519` compatible
private key for other blockchains.

```tsx
const web3authResponse = await web3auth.login({
  redirectUrl: resolvedRedirectUrl,
  mfaLevel: "default", // Pass on the mfa level of your choice: default, optional, mandatory, none
  loginProvider: "google", // Pass on the login provider of your choice: google, facebook, discord, twitch, twitter, github, linkedin, apple, etc.
});
```

:::info SDK Reference

- [`login()` function](/sdk/pnp/react-native/usage#logging-in-a-user).

:::

If you wish you **[add Multi Factor Authentication](/sdk/pnp/react-native/mfa)**,
**[use dApp Share](/sdk/pnp/react-native/dapp-share)**

- [Multi Factor Authentication](/sdk/pnp/react-native/mfa)
- [Using dApp Share](/sdk/pnp/react-native/dapp-share)

#### Sample loginResponse

<ReactNativeResponse />

### Get the User Profile

```tsx
// Assuming the user is logged in, get the user profile from the web3AuthResponse
var userInfo = web3authResponse.userInfo;
```

Using the `web3Auth.login()` function, you can get the details of the logged-in user. Please note
that these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth network.

#### Sample userInfo

<ReactNativeResponse />

### Logout

Use the `logout` function of `web3auth` to log the user out. This function doesn't work in iOS, so
you need to navigate the user back manually.

```tsx
web3auth.logout();
```

:::info SDK Reference

- [`logout()` function](/sdk/pnp/react-native/usage#logging-out-a-user).

## Interacting with the Blockchain

Once a user logs in, the Web3Auth SDK returns their reconstructed private key. For EVM Blockchains,
the `secp256k1` private key is used to sign transactions. We also return an `ed25519` compatible
private key for other blockchains. Similar to how we're using this private key in the `ethers.js`
library in this example, you can connect to any other blockchain of your choice.

:::info connect any blockchain

Please go through the [Connect Blockchain](/connect-blockchain/evm/ethereum/react-native)
Documentation, which contains all the details of the EVM based blockchain you have selected here.
