Merging RainbowKit with Web3Auth PnP (Plug and Play) SDK enables decentralized application (dApp)
developers to leverage Web3Auth's streamlined authentication processes alongside RainbowKit's
user-friendly wallet management interface. This integration utilizes Web3Auth's
[@web3auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector](https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/pnp/web/wagmi-connector) to bridge
RainbowKit with Web3Auth, facilitating a secure and efficient authentication mechanism for users.

## Rainbow + Web3Auth Connector

Using rainbow kit with web3auth is very straightforward. You will need to create a connector that
will connect the rainbow kit with web3auth. This connector will be used in the wagmi provider.

You will need to use mainly 8 libraries in this project: `@web3auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector`,
`@rainbow-me/rainbowkit` and `@web3auth/modal` or `@web3auth/no-modal`. Also we would need in the
project `@web3auth/base`, "@web3auth/ethereum-provider", `viem`, `wagmi` and
`@web3auth/auth-adapter`.

To install them, run:

```bash
npm install @web3auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector @rainbow-me/rainbowkit @web3auth/modal @web3auth/base @web3auth/ethereum-provider @web3auth/auth-adapter
```

\* you can replace modal with no-modal

The rainbow connector is the key that connect rainbowkit with web3auth. So in this file you will be
exporting the connector with the web3auth instance on it.

```jsx
import { Web3AuthConnector } from "@web3auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector";

...

const web3AuthInstance = new Web3Auth({
  clientId,
  web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
  privateKeyProvider,
  ... // all the config you need
  }
});

export const rainbowWeb3AuthConnector = (): Wallet => ({
  id: "web3auth",
  name: "web3auth",
  rdns: "web3auth",
  iconUrl: "https://web3auth.io/images/web3authlog.png",
  iconBackground: "#fff",
  installed: true,
  downloadUrls: {},
  createConnector: (walletDetails: WalletDetailsParams) =>
    createWagmiConnector((config) => ({
      ...Web3AuthConnector({
        web3AuthInstance,
      })(config),
      ...walletDetails,
    })),
});
```

## Implementing Chains and Providers

To ensure that your dApp supports various blockchain networks, you'll need to import and configure
the chains you intend to use, such as Ethereum's Mainnet, Polygon, or others. This step is crucial
for setting up the environment for transactions and interactions with the blockchain.

![Chains](/guides/rainbowkit/chains.jpg)

```jsx
import { sepolia, mainnet, polygon } from "wagmi/chains";

...

const config = getDefaultConfig({
  appName: 'My RainbowKit App Name',
  projectId: '<code>',
  chains: [mainnet, sepolia, polygon],
  transports: {
    [mainnet.id]: http(),
    [sepolia.id]: http(),
    [polygon.id]: http(),
  },
  wallets: [{
    groupName: 'Recommended',
    wallets: [
      rainbowWallet,
      rainbowWeb3AuthConnector,
      metaMaskWallet,
    ],
  }],
});
```

## Integrating with the UI

In the initial react screen you will need to create the wagmi provider with the QueryClientProvider
and the RainbowKitProvider inside.

The final step involves integrating the RainbowKitProvider and ConnectButton into your application's
UI. This is typically done at the root level of your application to ensure that the wallet
connection functionality is accessible throughout the dApp. The WagmiProvider and
QueryClientProvider wrap around the RainbowKit components, establishing the necessary context for
managing blockchain interactions and state.

```jsx
<WagmiProvider config={config}>
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    <RainbowKitProvider>
      <ConnectButton />
    </RainbowKitProvider>
  </QueryClientProvider>
</WagmiProvider>
```

## Conclusion

If you're using RainbowKit in your dApp, integrating Web3Auth is incredibly straightforward and
enhances your application's user experience significantly. The seamless integration process means
that you can provide your users with a more secure and efficient authentication mechanism without
compromising on the user-friendly interface that RainbowKit offers.

RainbowKit, known for its ease of wallet management, when combined with Web3Auth's authentication
solutions, essentially offers the best of both worlds. Web3Auth, with its Plug and Play (PnP) SDK,
simplifies the complex authentication processes often associated with decentralized applications.
This means that even developers with a basic understanding of JavaScript can integrate sophisticated
authentication mechanisms into their dApps.
