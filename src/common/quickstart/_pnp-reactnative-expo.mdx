### 1. Install Web3Auth

Install Web3Auth's PnP React Native SDK in your React Native project.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/react-native-sdk
```

When using our SDK with an Expo-based React Native app (aka managed workflow), you have to install the `expo-web-browser` package as a `WebBrowser`
implementation. You also need to install `expo-secure-store` to store the user's session.

```bash
expo install expo-web-browser expo-secure-store
```

:::warning

Please have a look at the troubleshooting guide [here](/troubleshooting/metro-issues), to set up the `globals.js` file and the `metro.config.js` file
for polyfilling.

:::

### 2. Get your Client ID from the Web3Auth Dashboard

Visit the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) and create a new project. Use the Client ID of the project to start your integration.

### 3. Create Web3Auth Instance

Construct the `Web3Auth` instance with:

```tsx
import * as WebBrowser from "expo-web-browser";
import * as SecureStore from "expo-secure-store";
import Web3Auth, { LOGIN_PROVIDER, OPENLOGIN_NETWORK } from "@web3auth/react-native-sdk";

const resolvedRedirectUrl =
  Constants.appOwnership == AppOwnership.Expo || Constants.appOwnership == AppOwnership.Guest
    ? Linking.createURL("web3auth", {})
    : Linking.createURL("web3auth", { scheme: scheme });

const clientId = "YOUR WEB3AUTH CLIENT ID";

const web3auth = new Web3Auth(WebBrowser, SecureStore, {
  clientId,
  network: OPENLOGIN_NETWORK.TESTNET, // or other networks
});
```

### 4. Login your User

Once you're done initializing, just create a button that triggers the login for the user on their request. Logging in is as easy as:

:::warning

Please note that the v4 react-native-sdk has some breaking changes. For instance, `web3auth.login` is a void method, unlike the older versions of the
SDK. Please refer to the [migration guide](/pnp/migration-guides/rn-v3-to-v4) for more

:::

```tsx
await web3auth.login({
  loginProvider: LoginProvider.GOOGLE,
  redirectUrl: resolvedRedirectUrl,
});
```

### 5. Troubleshooting Bundler Polyfill Issue with React Native

#### Install the missing modules

Check for the missing libraries in your build and included packages, and accordingly polyfill them. For Web3Auth, you need to polyfill the `buffer`,
`process`, `crypto` and `stream` libraries. For the rest of the libraries, we are installing a dummy module called `empty-module` which helps us get
rid of the warnings while building the project.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save empty-module readable-stream crypto-browserify react-native-get-random-values buffer process
```

:::caution

There might be a possibility that you might need to polyfill more libraries, in case you're using any other blockchain library alongside Web3Auth that
requires them. Generally, the libraries like `browserify-zlib`, `assert`, `stream-http`, `https-browserify`, `os-browserify`, `url` are the ones that
might be required.

:::

#### Update your `metro.config.js`

To make use of the polyfilled modules while building the application, you need to reconfigure your metro bundler config.

:::info Expo Managed Workflow

You will have to create `metro.config.js` for Expo Managed Workflow, as it is not present by default. Also, note that polyfilling is not supported
with "Expo Go" app. It is compatible only with Custom Dev Client and EAS builds.

Please run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native code based on the version of expo a project has installed, before moving forward.

:::

You can copy the following code in your `metro.config.js` file. This will tell the bundler to ignore the missing modules and include the ones that are
needed.

#### `metro.config.js`

```tsx title="metro.config.js"
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");

module.exports = (async () => {
  const {
    resolver: { sourceExts, assetExts },
  } = await getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

  const defaultSourceExts = [...sourceExts, "svg", "mjs", "cjs"];

  return {
    resolver: {
      extraNodeModules: {
        assert: require.resolve("empty-module"), // assert can be polyfilled here if needed
        http: require.resolve("empty-module"), // stream-http can be polyfilled here if needed
        https: require.resolve("empty-module"), // https-browserify can be polyfilled here if needed
        os: require.resolve("empty-module"), // os-browserify can be polyfilled here if needed
        url: require.resolve("empty-module"), // url can be polyfilled here if needed
        zlib: require.resolve("empty-module"), // browserify-zlib can be polyfilled here if needed
        path: require.resolve("empty-module"),
        crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
        stream: require.resolve("readable-stream"),
      },

      assetExts: assetExts.filter((ext) => ext !== "svg"),

      sourceExts: process.env.TEST_REACT_NATIVE ? ["e2e.js"].concat(defaultSourceExts) : defaultSourceExts,
    },
    transformer: {
      getTransformOptions: async () => ({
        transform: {
          experimentalImportSupport: false,
          inlineRequires: true,
        },
      }),
    },
  };
})();
```

#### Fixing additional dependency issues

- Create a `globals.js` to your project root directory and add the following code to it.

  ```tsx title="globals.js"
  global.Buffer = require("buffer").Buffer;

  // Needed so that 'stream-http' chooses the right default protocol.
  global.location = {
    protocol: "file:",
  };

  global.process.version = "v16.0.0";
  if (!global.process.version) {
    global.process = require("process");
    console.log({ process: global.process });
  }

  process.browser = true;
  ```

- Then, import the dependencies to `index.js` of your project.

  ```tsx title="index.js"
  import { AppRegistry } from "react-native";
  import "./globals";
  import "react-native-get-random-values";
  import App from "./App";
  import { name as appName } from "./app.json";
  AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
  ```
