The tKey SDK is the underlying SDK used to
implement Web3Auth Plug n Play. `tKey` stands for **Threshold Key**, which refers to the management keys and shares generated using threshold
cryptography.

The `tKey` SDK manages private keys by generating shares using **_Shamir Secret Sharing_**.

For a 2 out of 3 (2/3) setup, we give the user three shares: `ShareA`, `ShareB`, and `ShareC`.

- **ShareA** _is managed and split across Web3Auth's Auth Network_, accessed by an OAuth login provider that a user owns. For example, a user could
  use their Google account to access their share.
- **ShareB** _is stored on the user’s device_: The implementation is device and system specific. For example, on mobile devices, this share could be
  stored in device storage secured via biometrics.
- **ShareC** _is a recovery share_: An additional share to be kept by the user, possibly kept on a separate device, downloaded, or based on user input
  with enough entropy (e.g., password, security questions, hardware device, etc.).

Like existing 2FA systems, users must prove ownership of at least 2 out of 3 (2/3) shares to retrieve their private key.

:::tip

This setup can be further customised using the `tKey` SDK according to your needs, for example, 3/n flows or starting with 2/2. To learn more about
how our infrastructure works, please check out our **[Key Management Documentation](/overview/key-management)**.

:::caution

Implementation time is longer with tKey. Applications/wallets must ensure that tKey is implemented solely on the client side to be non-custodial for
users. If you need a faster and easier integration, use the **[Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs](/sdk/web/)**.
