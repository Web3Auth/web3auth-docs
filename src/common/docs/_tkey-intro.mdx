'tKey' is an abbreviation for Threshold Key, which is responsible for the management of wallet
shares produced using threshold cryptography. The tKey SDK manages wallets by generating shares via
Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme.

In a typical 2 out of 3 (2/3) setup, the user is provided with three shares: ShareA, ShareB, and
ShareC.

- **ShareA** is managed and divided across Web3Auth's Auth Network and can be accessed through an
  OAuth login provider owned by the user, like their Google account.
- **ShareB** is stored on the user's device. The method of storage is specific to the device and
  system. For instance, on mobile devices, the share could be stored in device storage that's
  secured with biometrics.
- **ShareC** serves as a recovery share. It's an extra share that the user can keep on a separate
  device, download, or base on user input with sufficient entropy. This could include a password,
  security questions, or a hardware device, among other options.

Like existing 2FA systems, users must prove ownership of at least 2 out of 3 (2/3) shares to
retrieve their private key.
