For Self Hosting, we give you the option to directly try out our open source, UI-less SDK, `tKey`. The tKey SDK is the underlying SDK used to
implement Web3Auth Plug n Play. tKey stands for Threshold Key, which refers to the management keys and shares generated using threshold cryptography.

The `tKey` SDK manages private keys by generating shares using Shamir Secret Sharing. For example, for a 2 out of 3 (2/3) setup, we give the user
three shares: ShareA, ShareB, and ShareC.

- **ShareA** is stored on the user’s device: Implementation is device and system specific. For example, on mobile devices, the share could be stored
  in device storage secured via biometrics.
- **ShareB** is managed and split across Web3Auth's Auth Network, accessed by an OAuth login provider that a user owns.
- **ShareC** is a recovery share: An additional share to be kept by the user, possibly kept on a separate device, downloaded, or based on user input
  with enough entropy (e.g., password, security questions, hardware device, etc.).

Like existing 2FA systems, users must prove ownership of at least 2 out of 3 (2/3) shares to retrieve their private key.

:::tip

This setup can be further customised using the `tKey` SDK according to your needs, for example, 3/n flows or starting with 2/2. To learn more about
how our infrastructure works, check out our [Key Management Documentation](/overview/key-management).

:::caution

Implementation time is longer with tKey. Applications/wallets must ensure that tKey is implemented solely on the client side to be non-custodial for
users. If you need a faster and easier integration, use the [Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs](/sdk/web/).
