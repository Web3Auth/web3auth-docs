To interact with the Ethereum blockchain in iOS Swift environment, we will be using the [web3swift](https://github.com/argentlabs/web3.swift) package.

### CocoaPods

Add web3.swift to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'web3.swift'
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

- Import the package and shims into your codebase:

```swift
import web3
```

Here are a few [sample apps](/examples?product=Plug+and+Play&sdk=Plug+and+Play+iOS+SDK) which you can checkout to get started with the integration.
