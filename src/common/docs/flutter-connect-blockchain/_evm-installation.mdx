To interact with the Ethereum blockchain in Flutter, you can use any [`EIP1193`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) compatible package. Here,
we're using [web3dart](https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart) to demonstrate how to make blockchain calls using it with Web3Auth.

```dart
flutter pub add web3dart shared_preferences
```

> Note: We will also be using `shared_preferences` package to share `privateKey`, used for making credentials for `web3dart`, at various places in the
> codes below.
