##### Importing the packages

```js
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES, SafeEventEmitterProvider } from "@web3auth/base";
import { Web3AuthCore } from "@web3auth/core";
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter";
```

Alongside the `Web3Auth` and `OpenloginAdapter` you need the above mentioned packages from `@web3auth/base` for different initialisations mentioned
further in this guide.

##### Instantiate the Web3Auth SDK

```js
import { Web3AuthCore } from "@web3auth/core";
import { CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

const web3auth = new Web3AuthCore({
  chainConfig: {
    clientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID",
    chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155, // SOLANA, OTHER
    chainId: "0x1",
  },
});
```

Here, we're using the `chainConfig` property to set the chainId and chainNamespace. The `chainId` and `chainNamespace` are the id and the namespace
respectively of the chain you're connecting to. We've initialised them for EVM for this guide. You can find the list of available providers
[here](/sdk/web/providers/) to select from.

Additionally, sometimes you might face clogging in the network, due to the fact that the test network is a bit clogged at that point. To avoid this,
we can use the property `rpcTarget` and pass over the url of the node you want to connect to.
