- Create a Project from the **Project** Section of the
  [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/).

  ![Plug n Play Project Creation on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/dashboard/create-project-name.png)

  - Enter your desired **Project name**.
  - Select the **Product** you want to use. For this guide, we'll be using the **Plug n Play**
    product.
  - Select the **Platform type** you want to use. For this guide, we'll be using the **Android** as
    the platform.
  - Select the Web3Auth Network as `Sapphire Devnet`. We recommend creating a project in the
    `Sapphire Devnet` network during development. While moving to a production environment, make
    sure to convert your project to `Sapphire Mainnet` or any of the legacy mainnet network
    `Mainet`, `Aqua`, or `Cyan` network. Otherwise, you'll end up losing users and keys.
  - Select the blockchain(s) you'll be building this project on. For interoperability with Torus
    Wallets, you have the option of allowing the user's private key to be used in other applications
    using Torus Wallets ([EVM](https://app.tor.us), [Solana](https://solana.tor.us),
    [XRPL](https://xrpl.tor.us) & [Casper](https://casper.tor.us)).
  - Finally, once you create the project, you have the option to whitelist your URLs for the
    project. **Please whitelist the domains where your project will be hosted.**
