Once installed, your Web3Auth application needs to be initialized. Initialization is a 4 step process where we add all the config details for
Web3Auth:

1. Instantiation
2. Configuration of Adapters
3. Configuration of Plugins
4. Initialization of the Web3Auth

Please make sure all of this is happening in your application constructor. This makes sure that Web3Auth is initialized when your application starts
up.
