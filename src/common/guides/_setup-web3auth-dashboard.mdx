- Create a Project from the **Project** Section of the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/).

  ![Plug n Play Project Creation on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/dashboard/create-project-name.png)

  - Enter your desired **Project name**.
  - Select the **Product** you want to use. For this guide, we'll be using the **Plug n Play** product.
  - Select the **Platform type** you want to use. For this guide, we'll be using the **Web Application** as the platform.
  - Select the Web3Auth Network as `Sapphire Devnet`. We recommend creating a project in the `sapphire_devnet` or `tesnet` network during development.
    While moving to a production environment, make sure to convert your project to `sapphire_mainnet` or any of the legacy mainnet network `mainnet`,
    `aqua`, or `cyan` network. Otherwise, you'll end up losing users and keys.
  - Select the blockchain(s) you'll be building this project on. For interoperability with Torus Wallets, you have the option of allowing the user's
    private key to be used in other applications using Torus Wallets ([EVM](https://app.tor.us), [Solana](https://solana.tor.us),
    [XRPL](https://xrpl.tor.us) & [Casper](https://casper.tor.us)).
  - Finally, once you create the project, you have the option to whitelist your URLs for the project. **Please whitelist the domains where your
    project will be hosted.**
