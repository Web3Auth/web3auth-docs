- Create an Auth0 tenant and configure a Single Page Web Application (SPA for Web) or Native (for Mobile) from
  [Auth0 Console](https://manage.auth0.com/).

- Please note that Regular Web Applications are also supported as mentioned in the flows above. However for this guide, we’re preferring SPA since its
  implicit flow doesn’t require an application to host a backend server.
