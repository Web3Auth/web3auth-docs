To use the Web3Auth SDK, you'll need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of
Web3Auth to your project. To know more about the available SDKs, please have a look at
[our SDK page](/sdk).

For this guide, we will be using the [Web3Auth iOS SDK](/sdk/pnp/ios).

### Installation

#### Swift Package Manager

<SPM />

#### Cocoapods

<Cocoapods />

#### Configuration

<Whitelist />

After Installation, the next step to use Web3Auth is to Initialize the SDK. Please note that these
are the most critical steps where you need to pass on different parameters according to the
preference of your project. Additionally, Whitelabeling and Custom Authentication have to be
configured within this step, if you wish to customise your Web3Auth Instance.
