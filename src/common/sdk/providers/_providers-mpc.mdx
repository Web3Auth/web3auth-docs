Providers are basically pre-configured RPC clients for different blockchains. They are used to
interact with the blockchain network. Web3Auth provides you with a few common providers for the most
commonly asked chains. For MPC, you can only use the dedicated providers provided by Web3Auth.

Currently, Web3Auth supports the following MPC provider:

## Base Type Reference for Web3Auth Providers

For facilitating these providers, Web3Auth exposes a `IProvider` which is a provider type helping
you make standardized RPC calls to a blockchain.

This provider contains two functions, `send` and `request`. You can find its type reference below:

```tsx
export interface IProvider extends SafeEventEmitter {
  sendAsync: <T, IProvider=> Promise<U>;
  send: <T, U>(req: JRPCRequest<T>, callback: SendCallBack<U>) => void;
  request: <T>(args: RequestArguments) => Promise<Maybe<T>>;
}

export interface JRPCRequest<T> extends JRPCBase {
  method: string;
  params?: T;
}
export interface JRPCBase {
  jsonrpc?: JRPCVersion;
  id?: JRPCId;
}
export declare type JRPCVersion = "2.0";
export declare type JRPCId = number | string | void;
export interface RequestArguments {
  method: string;
  params?: unknown[] | object;
}
```
