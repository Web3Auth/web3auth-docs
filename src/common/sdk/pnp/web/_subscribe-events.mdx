Subscribing to events help you trigger responses based on the status of the connection of the user. An adapter emits certain events like `CONNECTED`,
`CONNECTING` and `DISCONNECTED` etc during login lifecycle of a user. For example, you can use this to show an error message, if the user is not
connected to the network. Generally, this is not a required step and should be done only if needed in particular cases.

This step is totally optional. If you don't want to use any plugins, feel free to skip this section.

:::tip

If you're using the `uxMode: "redirect"` option within your [`openlogin-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin) configuration, you need to
subscribe to the event to handle the logging in implicitly. This is because, when redirected to a different application, the app state is not updated
as per the login status. Using a lifecycle method to check this, one can easily handle the login status within the constructor function.

#### `on(EVENT, CALLBACK)`

Web3Auth provides the following lifecycle event to check the login status:
