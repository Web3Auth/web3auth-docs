Effortlessly create and manage smart accounts for your users with just a few lines of code, using
our native account abstraction. Additionally, SCWs offer enhanced control and programmability,
enabling features like those listed below.

- Gas Abstraction: Cover transaction fees for users, or allow users to pay for their own
  transactions using ERC-20 tokens.
- Batch Transactions: Perform multiple transactions in a single call.
- Automated Transactions: Allow users to automate actions, like swapping ETH to USDT when ETH hits
  $4,000.
- Set Spending Limits: Allow users to set tailored spending limits.

Our native AA integration streamlines your setup, allowing you to create and manage smart accounts
using your favorite libraries like Viem, Ethers, and Web3.js. With this, you don't need to rely on
third party packages to effortlessly create ERC-4337 compatible Smart Contract Wallets (SCWs), and
give users the ability to perform batch transactions and efficiently manage gas sponsorship.

Web3Auth's native account abstraction gives you the flexibility to choose your preferred account
abstraction provider, configure your bundler client, and integrate your paymaster. For more insights
