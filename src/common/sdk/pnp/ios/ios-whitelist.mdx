To use Web3Auth for iOS you need to Whitelist your `bundleId` in your Web3Auth project.

- Go to [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io), and create or open an
  existing Web3Auth project.
- Whitelist `(bundleId)://auth` in the developer dashboard. This step is mandatory for the redirect
  to work.
