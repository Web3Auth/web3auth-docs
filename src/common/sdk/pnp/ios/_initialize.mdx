If you don't want to create a plist file and want to use optional configuration parameters, you can
construct the Web3Auth instance with

```swift
import Web3Auth

let web3auth = Web3Auth(W3AInitParams(
  clientId: "<your clientId>",
  network: .sapphire_mainnet,
))
```

After creating a `Web3Auth` instance using one of the above methods, you can use the instance to
call various methods.
