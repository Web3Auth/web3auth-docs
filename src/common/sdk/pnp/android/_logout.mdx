Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout()` function. This method will clear the
session data and the user will be logged out from Web3Auth.

```kotlin
private fun logOut() {
  val logoutCompletableFuture =  web3Auth.logout()
  logoutCompletableFuture.whenComplete { _, error ->
  if (error == null) {
    // render logout UI
  } else {
    // render error UI
  }
  }
}
```
