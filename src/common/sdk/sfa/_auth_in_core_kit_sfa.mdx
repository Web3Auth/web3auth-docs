## How Authentication works

The Single Factor Auth (SFA) SDK enables the creation of embedded wallets using your preferred
authentication provider. Unlike the traditional auth service flow, where users are redirected to
Web3Auth's user flow screens for verification, the SFA SDK facilitates seamless authentication
without requiring a redirect. For a clearer understanding, please refer to the user flow screens
below.

Since SFA handles authentication without redirect, you'll need to create a verifier and manage the
OAuth login yourself. After setting up the verifier and completing the OAuth login, pass the JWT
token, verifier name, and JWT verifier ID. These details are sent to the Web3Auth network, where
they are verified using the JWKS and authentication fields specified in your verifier.

On the Web3Auth network, there are nine nodes that independently verify these details. Verification
is considered successful when at least five out of the nine nodes confirm the details. Once
authentication is successful, you can use the private key to derive the user's public key and
perform on-chain transactions.

## Create a verifier

For Single Factor Auth(SFA) SDK you'll need to create your own verifier choosing your preferred
provider, and appropriate details. To create a verifier,
