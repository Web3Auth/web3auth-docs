Once you have an `Web3AuthMPCCoreKit` instance, it can be used as along with `solana/web3.js`
package.

To generate the Solana EOA address, you can use the `getPubKeyEd25519` method to retrieve the
ed25519 curve compatible pubKey. Since solana uses the base58 enocded address, you can simply encode
pubKey with base58 to get the user's EOA address.

```tsx
import { base58 } from "@scure/base";

const address = base58.encode(Uint8Array.from(coreKitInstance.getPubKeyEd25519()));
```

If you want to verify that the public key is on ed25519 curve, you can create a new `PublicKey`
instance using the generated `address`. Once you have the `PublicKey` instance, you can use the
`isOnCurve` static method to verify the curve.

```tsx
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

const publicKey = new PublicKey(address);

// Returns whether the public is on ed25519 curve
const isValidAddress = PublicKey.isOnCurve(publicKey.toBytes());
```
